<p class="ph3">THE MYSTERIOUS BOX</p>


<p>Tap! Tap! Tap!</p>

<p>Some one was knocking on the door of the
kitchen where Dinah Johnson, the fat, jolly,
colored cook of the Bobbsey family was just
taking a pie from the oven. Holding the pie
carefully, Dinah turned her head toward the
door.</p>

<p>Tap! Tap! Tap! sounded again.</p>

<p>“Good lan’ ob massy! Wonder who dat
am?” murmured Dinah. “Maybe it am one
ob dem woodpecker birds whut fly ’round de
garden lookin’ fo’ bugs in de trees. But if
Mistah Woodpecker t’inks he’s gwine t’ look
at dis pie, he’s mighty much mistook—dat’s
all I got to say!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span></p>

<p>Dinah waddled over to the table, carrying
the pie carefully, and then, as the knocking
again sounded on the kitchen door, she
walked toward it and opened it.</p>

<p>“Git away from heah, Mistah Woodpecker!”
she exclaimed, before she really saw
who it was. Then she started back in surprise,
for Bert Bobbsey, carrying in his hands
something wrapped in paper, slid quickly
through the half-opened door and exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Don’t tell Nan or Flossie or Freddie that
I came in this way, Dinah! I want to get
upstairs—quick!”</p>

<p>“Mah goodness! Bress yo’ heart, honey!
Has anyt’ing done happened dat yo’ got to
slip in in dis mysteriousness way an’ hide upstairs?
Whut’s de mattah?” demanded the
colored cook.</p>

<p>“Hush, please, Dinah! It’s all right. I
just don’t want any of the others to know I
came in this way!” explained Bert, with a
smile, which told the cook that there was
nothing very much wrong. “I’m going upstairs
to hide this,” Bert went on. “If
Flossie comes in don’t tell her you saw me.”</p>

<p>“Oh—all right,” remarked Dinah, with a
chuckle. “Ah done guess it’s some game<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>
dem Bobbsey twins is playin’,” she went on
to herself. “Bress der hearts! Nices’ chilluns
dat eber was! Dat’s it! Some game
Bert is playin’ like hide de organ or find de
auttymobile, Ah reckon! Ho! Ho!”</p>

<p>She laughed softly to herself as she waddled
back to the oven to take out another pie,
while Bert crept up the back stairs on tiptoe,
still carrying the paper package of which he
took great care.</p>

<p>“Dat’s what it must be—some game!”
murmured Dinah, and then, as she set the
second pie on the table, again came the sound
of knocking at the door.</p>

<p>“Go on away, Freddie!” went on Dinah.
“Ah can’t bodder wif yo’ any more. Once
is enough to come in mah kitchen when Ah’s
busy wif pies! Run along, Freddie!”</p>

<p>“Hush, Dinah, please!” came a voice from
the outer side of the door. “This isn’t
Freddie. I’m Nan! Please open the door
and let me in. I can’t turn the knob—my
hands are full!”</p>

<p>“Well, mah good lan’ ob massy!” exclaimed
the colored cook, as she gave a hasty
look at the oven to make sure the third pie,
still in the stove, would not burn. “Fust<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
comes Bert, an’ his hands is full; den comes
Nan, an’ her hands is full. Whut’s gwine on
in dish yeah house to-day Ah wonders?”</p>

<p>But remembering that Bert had begged her
not to mention how he had entered, Dinah
said nothing to Nan of this when she opened
the door and saw Bert’s twin sister standing
there, holding in her arms a brown paper
parcel, larger than the one Bert had carried
up the back stairs.</p>

<p>“Thank you, Dinah, for letting me in,”
whispered Nan, with a smile. “This bundle
is so big I couldn’t reach the knob. Please
don’t tell Flossie or Freddie or Bert that I
came in this way, will you?”</p>

<p>“No’m—Ah won’t say one word!” promised
Dinah, as she watched Nan tiptoe quietly
up the back stairs.</p>

<p>Chuckling to herself, Dinah went back to
the oven to get out the third pie, meanwhile
having shut the outer kitchen door, for she
did not want any draft of air blowing on her
fresh pastry.</p>

<p>So she had closed the door and had set the
third pie on the table when she was so startled
that she gave a jump for, looking at one of
the kitchen windows, she saw Freddie Bobbsey<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
trying in vain to raise it. The window
was partly open, but not wide enough for the
little fellow to slip in.</p>

<p>“Dinah! Dinah! Open the window and
let me in!” he begged. “And please hurry!
It’s very ’portant!”</p>

<p>“Um! It important, am it?” asked Dinah.
“Den why doesn’t yo’ come in de do’ laik de
others done?” She meant Bert and Nan, but
no sooner had she spoken than she remembered
that the two older Bobbsey twins had
each begged her to keep quiet about them.
Luckily, however, Freddie did not pay much
attention to the last part of Dinah’s remarks.</p>

<p>“I don’t want to come in the door ’cause
Flossie will see me!” he explained, trying to
wiggle under the partly raised sash. “She’s
out in the yard, watching, and I don’t want
her to see me. So open the window and let
me in, please, Dinah!”</p>

<p>“Aw right, honey lamb, I will,” promised
the cook. “Dis suah mus’ be some funny
game de Bobbsey twins am playin’,” she
thought to herself. “An’ Freddie’s got a
bundle, too! Dish suah am queer!”</p>

<p>Indeed, Freddie had a bundle. It was
wrapped in a white cloth and was almost as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
large as himself, though it was not very
heavy, for he lifted it easily into the window
ahead of him, when Dinah had raised the
sash higher.</p>

<p>“There! I guess Flossie didn’t see me,”
murmured the little boy.</p>

<p>Instead of going up the back stairs as his
older brother and sister had done, Freddie
made for the cellarway which opened out of
the kitchen.</p>

<p>“Where you going?” demanded Dinah, as
she saw what the small lad was about to do.</p>

<p>“Hush!” he begged, holding a finger over
his lips. “This is a secret! I want to hide it
down the cellar. He’ll never think of looking
for it down there!”</p>

<p>“What is it?” asked the colored woman.
“Who won’t look down there for it? What
is it, Freddie?”</p>

<p>But Freddie did not answer. He was going
softly down the cellar stairs, carrying the
package in cloth, almost as big as himself.</p>

<p>“If dis wasn’t summer Ah suah would t’ink
it was Christmus, wif everybody hidin’ presents,”
Dinah murmured. “But Christmus
don’t come in June! It mus’ be some
game!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span></p>

<p>She was just reaching for the tin can of
powdered sugar which she intended sprinkling
on the pies when a noise behind her caused
her to turn quickly. She saw, tiptoeing out
of the pantry, Flossie Bobbsey, Freddie’s
blue-eyed twin sister. Flossie, also, carried
a good-sized package.</p>

<p>“Hello, Dinah!” murmured Flossie.
“Those pies smell good!” and she hungrily
sniffed the air. “But don’t tell anybody you
saw me!” she went on, with a smile, and she
crossed the kitchen in the direction of a door
that led to the back hall.</p>

<p>“Where’d you come from?” demanded
Dinah. “I was in dat pantry a little bit ago
an’ you wasn’t in it, Flossie!”</p>

<p>“I know!” giggled the little girl. “I got
up on a box and crawled in the window. It
was open. I didn’t want Freddie to see me.
He was out in the yard and I slipped away
from him. I’m going to hide this in the little
closet under the stairs,” she went on, holding
up the box she carried.</p>

<p>“What is it?” asked Dinah.</p>

<p>“It’s a secret!” answered Flossie, with a
smile. “Bert and Nan aren’t around, are
they?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span></p>

<p>“No, they aren’t ’round now,” replied the
cook.</p>

<p>“I’m glad of that,” said Flossie, with a
sigh of relief as she tossed her tangle of golden
curls back out of her eyes. “I don’t want
any of them to know until we are at the table
this evening.”</p>

<p>“What’s it all about?” asked Dinah, more
from habit by this time than because she expected
to be told. “Is it a game, honey
lamb?”</p>

<p>“Sort of!” laughed Flossie. “But it’s
more of a secret!”</p>

<p>“Um! Yeah! I could guess dat part ob
it!” chuckled Dinah. “It suah am a secret!”</p>

<p>She watched Flossie slip quietly out into
the back hall and heard the little girl opening
the small closet under the stairs, where all
sorts of odds and ends were kept.</p>

<p>With a silent laugh, which shook her big,
fat body as a bowl of jelly is shaken when it
is placed on the table, the colored cook went
on with her kitchen work. Soon she heard
the voice of Bert as he went down the front
stairs and out of the front door.</p>

<p>“Ah guess Nan didn’t ketch him,” murmured
Dinah.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span></p>

<p>A little later, down the back stairway,
floated the voice of Nan, speaking to her
mother in the latter’s room.</p>

<p>“An’ Ah reckon Bert didn’t see Nan,”
went on Dinah. “So far it’s all right. Dat
is ef dey don’t ketch Flossie in de back hall.”</p>

<p>But this did not happen, because Flossie
remained in the little closet under the stairs
for some time. She appeared to be taking
great pains to hide the box she was carrying.</p>

<p>However, a little later Flossie came softly
back into the kitchen through the door leading
to the back hall.</p>

<p>“There! Nobody knows where it is but
me!” she declared.</p>

<p>“Dat’s good,” murmured Dinah.</p>

<p>“And maybe I could have a piece of pie,”
went on the little girl. “I think you bake
the loveliest pies, Dinah! Honest I do!”</p>

<p>“Yes’m, honey lamb, dey is good!” admitted
the cook, with pardonable pride in
her work. “But Ah cain’t cut a fresh pie
fo’ yo!”</p>

<p>“Oh, dear!” sighed Flossie.</p>

<p>There was a noise on the cellar stairs and
Dinah wondered if Freddie were coming up.</p>

<p>But nothing like this happened. The cellar<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
door did not open, and Flossie did not
appear to have heard the noise.</p>

<p>“Isn’t there anything you can give me to
eat, Dinah?” she asked wistfully. “I’m so
hungry!”</p>

<p>“Bress yo’ heart, honey lamb! Ah kin gib
yo’ some ’lasses cookies!” replied Dinah.</p>

<p>“Oh, molasses cookies! I just love them!”
cried Flossie, and when she had several in
her hands she ran out, crying: “Freddie!
Freddie! Where are you? I got cookies!”</p>

<p>Freddie did not answer, and the voice of
Flossie died away as she ran in search of him.</p>

<p>But pretty soon the kitchen cellar door
opened and Freddie’s head was thrust out.
Dinah heard the noise of the knob and turned
to look at the little fellow.</p>

<p>“Is she gone?” whispered Freddie. “Is
Flossie gone?”</p>

<p>“She suah has,” was the reply.</p>

<p>“I’m glad she didn’t see me,” he went on.
“I got it hid down behind the coal bin.”</p>

<p>“Good lan’!” exclaimed Dinah. “Whut’s
it all about, anyhow?”</p>

<p>“Hush!” begged Freddie in a whisper. “I
got Daddy a present for his birthday—it’s
to-morrow, you know. I found a basket and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
I picked it full of flowers. And in the bottom
of the basket is a new baseball. I saved up
my money and bought it for him. He’ll think
there’s only flowers in the basket, but down
under them’s the baseball. An’ if Daddy
doesn’t want it to play with himself he can
give it to me; can’t he, Dinah?”</p>

<p>“Ah reckon he can, honey!” chuckled the
colored cook.</p>

<p>“Don’t you think that’s a ’riginal present
for Daddy, Dinah?” asked the little fellow.
“I wanted to give him something ’riginal!”</p>

<p>“It suah am ’riginal, all right,” admitted
Dinah. “An’ here’s some cookies fo’ yo’.
Better run out now an’ play!”</p>

<p>“I will,” agreed Freddie. “But don’t tell
anybody about my ’riginal present for Daddy,
will you?”</p>

<p>“No, Ah won’t,” Dinah promised.</p>

<p>It was a little while after this that Flossie
came running back, begging for more cookies.</p>

<p>“Have yo’ done eat all dem up I gib yo’?”
asked Dinah.</p>

<p>“I gave some to Mary Blake and some to
Sallie Porter,” explained Flossie, naming two
of her playmates. “So I didn’t have many
myself.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span></p>

<p>“Dat’s too bad!” murmured Dinah. “But
dere’s plenty mo’ cookies! He’p yo’se’f,
honey,” and she brought out the pan.</p>

<p>Flossie looked around the kitchen to make
sure none but Dinah could hear her, and
then she whispered:</p>

<p>“Dinah, do you know what was in that
box I hid in the stair closet? Do you?”</p>

<p>The cook could pretty well guess by this
time, but she pretended she did not know
and shook her head.</p>

<p>“It’s a present for daddy’s birthday,” went
on Flossie. “I’m going to give it to him
when we eat supper. Do you know what it
is?”</p>

<p>Again Dinah shook her head.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll tell you, but you mustn’t tell anybody!”
whispered Flossie. “It’s a little
folding go-cart for a doll. I think Daddy
will like that, don’t you? It’s the cutest
little go-cart and it all folds up small and
goes in a box. But you can unfold it big
enough to ride my largest doll. Isn’t that a
nice present for Daddy?”</p>

<p>“It suah am!” laughed Dinah.</p>

<p>Though Bert and Nan said nothing to her
about the packages they had so secretly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
hidden, Dinah guessed that the older twins
had also bought presents for their father’s
birthday, which occurred on the morrow,
but which would be celebrated that evening,
as usual.</p>

<p>“Ah wonders if Bert an’ Nan got t’ings
laik Freddie an’ Flossie?” chuckled Dinah.
“Dose small twins suah am lookin’ out for
derse’ves!”</p>

<p>It was later in the afternoon, and the
Bobbsey twins were gathering about the
house to get washed and dressed for supper,
when the doorbell rang.</p>

<p>“I’ll go!” cried Nan, making a dash for the
hall.</p>

<p>Bert was also ready to answer the ring, but
his twin sister was a little bit ahead of him.
And Flossie and Freddie were not far behind
Bert, who ran out into the front hall in time
to see Nan talking to the driver of an express
wagon.</p>

<p>“Does Mr. Richard Bobbsey live here?”
asked the expressman.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” answered Nan.</p>

<p>“But he isn’t home from the office yet,”
added Bert.</p>

<p>“Well, I guess that won’t matter,” went<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
on the man, with a laugh. “I have a box
here for him. The charges are paid so I will
leave it, if one of you will sign the receipt for
it.”</p>

<p>“I’ll sign,” offered Nan, as she had often
heard her mother say.</p>

<p>The box was set down in the front hall.
It was of wood, and seemed quite heavy.</p>

<p>“What’s in it?” asked Bert.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” the expressman answered.
“Maybe it has a fortune in gold in it. Anyhow,
there’s something that rattles. And a
letter came to the office, asking us to deliver
the box just before supper this evening.
Maybe it has something good to eat in it.”</p>

<p>He drove away with a laugh, while the
Bobbsey twins gathered about the mysterious
box in the hall—a box that had come to their
father on the eve of his birthday.</p>

<p>What was in it?</p>

<p>That is what each of the Bobbsey twins
wondered.</p>

</div>

<p class="ph3">QUEER NOISES</p>


<p>“What is going on down there, my dears?”
called Mrs. Bobbsey from the top of the stairs.
Down in the hall below she could see, gathered
about the mysterious box, the four
twins. She had heard the bell ring, and at
first thought it was her husband, coming home
early on account of the birthday celebration.</p>

<p>But when she heard the strange tones of
the expressman she realized that something
else had happened, and she was curious to
know what it was about.</p>

<p>“It’s a big box for Daddy,” explained Bert.</p>

<p>“We don’t know where it’s from,” went on
Nan.</p>

<p>“And the ’spress man didn’t know what
was in it,” added Flossie.</p>

<p>“But I guess it’s for Daddy’s birthday,”
exclaimed Freddie. “And I got——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span></p>

<p>He stopped just in time. He had been
about to speak of the “’riginal” present he
himself had hidden down cellar.</p>

<p>“Well, if it’s for Daddy we must let it alone
until he comes home,” said Mrs. Bobbsey.
“Come now and get ready for supper. It will
not be long before Daddy arrives, and he will
open the box.”</p>

<p>“I wonder what’s in it,” murmured Bert as
he moved away, with a backward look at the
mysterious package.</p>

<p>“And I wonder where it’s from,” said Nan,
who was as curious as her brother.</p>

<p>But they would not think of trying to open
it, or of trying to pry off one corner to look
inside. Indeed, this would have been hard
to do, since the box was strongly made.</p>

<p>Flossie and Freddie were as eager as their
older brother and sister to know about the
box. But perhaps they were thinking so
much of their own presents that they did not
say much about the package the expressman
had delivered.</p>

<p>While the four are getting ready for the
evening meal I will beg just a few moments
of the time of my new readers to introduce
them to the Bobbsey twins. There were four<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
of the twins, as you have learned by this time.
Bert and Nan, who had dark hair and eyes,
were the older pair, and Flossie and Freddie,
whose eyes were blue and whose hair was
golden, came next. Their father was Richard
Bobbsey, who owned a large lumberyard in
the eastern city of Lakeport on Lake Metoka.</p>

<p>“The Bobbsey Twins” is the name of the
first book which tells about these children and
what happened to them and their friends.
After that Bert and his brother and sisters
had many adventures in the country, at the
seashore, and at school.</p>

<p>From Snow Lodge the twins went on a
voyage in a houseboat and then to Meadow
Brook. Happenings at home, in a great city,
on Blueberry Island and, later, on the deep,
blue sea, kept the boys and girls busy for
several vacations, and then they went to
Washington, where some strange happenings
occurred. But no more strange, perhaps,
than in the great West or at Cedar Camp.</p>

<p>The county fair, where Mr. Bobbsey took
his children, was a most interesting event,
and when they went camping out they had
great fun.</p>

<p>But the finding of Baby May was, perhaps,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
the most mysterious thing that ever happened
to the Bobbseys. They found a little
baby on their doorstep after a storm, and
kept the infant, calling her Baby May Washington
Bobbsey, because a queer woman, who
had been seen at the railroad station with the
baby’s basket, had murmured a name something
like “Washington.”</p>

<p>But this proved to be a mistake, since the
baby’s right name was Jenny Watson. She
was the daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Henry
Watson, and had been left in charge of a
Mrs. Martin while Mr. and Mrs. Watson
made a voyage to South America. Mrs.
Martin was Mrs. Watson’s cousin.</p>

<p>Because of an accident, when some dishes
fell on her head, Mrs. Martin went crazy
and had an idea that she must give Baby
Jenny away, which she did, by leaving the
infant on the Bobbsey steps.</p>

<p>In due time “Baby May,” the name by
which Flossie and Freddie still called the
little child, was taken to her mother and
father, and Mrs. Martin, who recovered from
her crazy spell, and the Watsons became
good friends of the Bobbsey family.</p>

<p>Following the excitement over the finding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
of the baby, the Bobbsey twins had some
very strange adventures which you will find
set down in the book just before the one you
are now reading. That volume is entitled
“The Bobbsey Twins Keeping House,” and
tells what happened when Mr. and Mrs.
Bobbsey had to go away, when Dinah and
Sam also departed, and when Mrs. Pry, the
housekeeper who had been engaged by Mrs.
Bobbsey, was taken ill.</p>

<p>However, everything comes to an end in
time, and finally all was straightened out in
the Bobbsey house. This took place in the
winter, and now it was the beginning of
summer, and the eve of Mr. Bobbsey’s birthday.</p>

<p>The mysterious box—at least the twins
thought it was mysterious—had arrived, and
they were all excited, waiting for their father
to come home to open it.</p>

<p>“Isn’t Daddy late to-night?” asked Nan,
when she had finished dressing and had gone
into her mother’s room.</p>

<p>“No, not later than usual,” answered Mrs.
Bobbsey, with a smile as she glanced at the
clock on her bureau.</p>

<p>“Then time is going awfully slow!” commented<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
Bert, looking in from the hall. “I
wish Daddy would hurry! I want to see him
open his birthday box.”</p>

<p>“Don’t be too sure that is a box for Daddy’s
birthday,” remarked Mrs. Bobbsey. “It
may be something about business.”</p>

<p>“If it was business they would send it to
him at his office,” came from Nan.</p>

<p>“Besides,” added Bert, “the expressman
said they got a letter asking ’em to deliver
the box before supper this evening, and everybody
knows we always give Daddy his presents
at supper on the night before his birthday.”</p>

<p>“So we do,” agreed Mrs. Bobbsey. “But
not every one knows that, Bert. However,
if you children have any presents for your
father perhaps you had better be getting them
ready. I suppose you are going to give him
something, aren’t you?” she asked, with a
smile.</p>

<p>Instead of answering, the four twins looked
one at the other. Each one was trying to
keep a secret, but it was not easy. But before
they could reply there was heard from
the hall below the noise of a door opening.</p>

<p>“There’s Daddy now!” cried Bert.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span></p>

<p>“Wait for me!” begged Flossie, as she
saw the others make a dash out of the
room.</p>

<p>“Let me go first!” begged Freddie, and he
was so anxious to get ahead of Bert that he
stooped down and crawled between the legs
of his brother, just as Bert was in the doorway
of his mother’s room.</p>

<p>So eager was Freddie, and such a shove
did he give himself to crawl through Bert’s
legs that, before he knew what was happening,
the fat little lad had slipped, rolled to
the top of the stairs, and then he rolled
all the way down, bumping from step to
step.</p>

<p>But, as it happened, Mr. Bobbsey reached
the bottom of the flight of stairs in time to
catch Freddie before the little fellow reached
the last step.</p>

<p>“Well, well, what’s all this?” cried Mr.
Bobbsey, holding Freddie in his arms. “Is
my little fireman trying to make a rescue?”
Mr. Bobbsey often spoke of Freddie as a
“fireman,” since the little fellow was so fond
of playing that game. He had a toy fire engine
that spouted real water, too. And Flossie’s
pet name was “little fat fairy.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span></p>

<p>“Is he hurt?” asked Mrs. Bobbsey, coming
down the stairs.</p>

<p>“No—I’m all right!” protested Freddie.
“I—now—I just slipped—that’s all. I was
in a hurry.”</p>

<p>“I should say you were!” laughed his
father. “But you are so fat and the stairs
are so thickly carpeted, that you aren’t hurt
a bit!”</p>

<p>Freddie was set upon his feet, and, with
the others, made a circle about Mr. Bobbsey
and the mysterious box. Then, for the first
time, the lumber merchant appeared aware
of the bulky package in the lower hall.</p>

<p>“What’s this?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Something for you, it seems,” answered
his wife.</p>

<p>“It’s for your birthday!” cried Nan.</p>

<p>“It came by express!” added Bert.</p>

<p>“And we’d like to see what’s in it,” remarked
Flossie.</p>

<p>“Don’t go ’way now,” begged Freddie.
“’Cause there’s other things for you—I mean
for your birthday—I guess they are,” he
added, not wanting to appear too sure. “But
open this box first.”</p>

<p>“All right,” agreed Mr. Bobbsey. “It’s a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
surprise to me, I’ll say that. I don’t even
know where it’s from.”</p>

<p>“Maybe it tells on the other side,” suggested
Bert, who had brought a hammer and
a screw driver for his father to use in opening
the box.</p>

<p>“Perhaps,” was the answer. “We’ll take
a look.”</p>

<p>As he turned the box on its other side to
discover whence it had come, a strange sound
was heard issuing from inside.</p>

<p>“Oh!” cried Flossie. “It sounds like a
little baby!”</p>

<p>“Nonsense!” laughed her mother. “There
would be no baby in such a box!”</p>

<p>Mr. Bobbsey now had the box turned on
the other side, and there appeared a card
which read:</p>

<p>“From Mr. and Mrs. Henry Watson of
Cloverbank!”</p>

<p>“Oh, Mr. Watson remembered your birthday!
How nice!” exclaimed Mrs. Bobbsey.
“I didn’t think he knew it.”</p>

<p>“Nor did I,” said Mr. Bobbsey, as he got
ready to pry off the box cover.</p>

<p>“Watson! Watson!” murmured Bert,
thinking hard. “Oh, yes!” he cried. “That’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
the name of the father and mother of Baby
May, whom we found on our doorstep. That
box came from Baby May!”</p>

<p>“Yes, or from her parents,” said Mr.
Bobbsey.</p>

<p>As he moved the box, in order to get a
better chance to pry off the cover, again there
came from inside it a strange wailing cry.</p>

<p>“Oh, Daddy! Open it—quick!” cried
Freddie. “Baby May must be inside that
box. Her father and mother sent her back
to you for a birthday present! Open it—quick—and
take Baby May out!”</p>

<p>“Nonsense!” exclaimed Mrs. Bobbsey.
“Nobody would put a baby in a box like that
and send it by express!”</p>

<p>The queer noises sounded again, and, really,
they seemed to be such cries as a baby might
make.</p>

<p>“Open the box! Open the box!” cried
Nan, much excited, and Mr. Bobbsey hurriedly
began using the hammer and screw
driver while the twins and their mother
leaned eagerly forward.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III</h2>
</div>

<p class="ph3">AN INVITATION</p>


<p>Neither Mr. nor Mrs. Bobbsey thought
for a moment that “Baby May,” as they still
called her, was in the box. Still there was
certainly something very queer about the
noises that came from the express package.</p>

<p>“It sure is a baby,” murmured Flossie.</p>

<p>“It’s a queer baby then,” declared Nan.
“I can see a lot of green and red and yellow
things, and no baby is that color!”</p>

<p>For by this time her father had removed
some of the boards from the box and a view
could be had inside. And, as Nan had said,
there was a glimpse of something red, green,
and yellow.</p>

<p>“Maybe Baby May—I mean Baby Jenny—has
paint on,” suggested Flossie.</p>

<p>“Ho! Ho!” laughed Freddie. “Who ever
heard of painting a baby?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span></p>

<p>“My doll has paint on, and she’s a baby,”
retorted Flossie. Then the little girl thought
of the present she had bought for her father—the
folding go-cart hidden in the closet under
the stairs, and she cried: “Oh, do please hurry,
Daddy! Open your present and then maybe
you’ll get some other presents!”</p>

<p>“Oh, I hardly think so,” replied Mr. Bobbsey,
still working away with the hammer
and the screw driver. “I guess this is the
only present I’ll get this birthday. It was
very kind of Mr. Watson to remember
me!”</p>

<p>Though he said this, Mr. Bobbsey did not
really mean that, for well he knew each of the
twins, as well as his wife, would give him
something. They had every year since the
two older twins were big enough to know
about birthdays.</p>

<p>But Flossie and Freddie, thinking their
father really meant what he said, burst out
eagerly to deny his fear that he was to be
forgotten.</p>

<p>“Oh, no, Daddy!” cried Flossie. “You’re
going to get another present—a lovely one!”</p>

<p>“Yes, and another one too, besides that!”
added Freddie.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span></p>

<p>“You don’t mean it!” cried Mr. Bobbsey,
pretending to be very much surprised.
“Well! Well! I must hurry and finish
opening this box, for, after I see what is in it,
I’ll get the other presents—maybe.”</p>

<p>“You sure will!” chuckled Bert.</p>

<p>“Listen!” whispered Nan.</p>

<p>Again came a low, wailing cry from within
the box.</p>

<p>“There!” suddenly cried Mr. Bobbsey.
He pried off nearly all of the top boards and
out from the midst of a lot of vegetables
jumped—Snoop! Snoop, the big, black
Bobbsey cat!</p>

<p>“Oh!” cried Freddie. “Look at him!”</p>

<p>“Snoop!” shouted Bert.</p>

<p>“How in the world did he get in there?”
asked Nan.</p>

<p>But Snoop waved his tail, rubbed up
against the legs of fat little Flossie, and gave
voice to a miaowing cry.</p>

<p>“There!” exclaimed Mrs. Bobbsey. “It
was Snoop who was crying like a baby. He
was shut up inside that box, and his voice
sounded muffled, as if he were down in the
cellar. That’s what made it seem to be a
baby’s cry.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span></p>

<p>“But how did Snoop get in the box?”
asked Freddie.</p>

<p>Mr. Bobbsey turned the express package
over on its side and then it was seen how
Snoop had gotten inside. One of the bottom
boards was broken. There was a hole large
enough for the black cat to have crawled inside,
and as Snoop was very like his name,
always snooping around in strange places,
that is what he had done. He had crawled
in through the hole and had curled up among
a lot of vegetables. Then, when the box was
turned over, so Mr. Bobbsey could read the
card, telling whence it had come, Snoop could
not get out. So he had cried mournfully to
be released.</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s a lot of vegetables and berries
in the box!” said Nan, as she took a look,
after Snoop had jumped out and the mystery
of the “baby’s” cries had been solved.</p>

<p>“Yes, it’s quite a load of farm and garden
produce,” said Mr. Bobbsey. “Mr. Watson
must have a large place at Cloverbank.
Here’s a note,” and he picked up one that was
stuck in a bunch of beets.</p>

<p>The note was from Mr. Watson. It contained
only a few short lines, saying:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Dear Mr. Bobbsey: My wife and I remembered
that this was your birthday, so we
send you some of our early vegetables and
some berries. You were so kind to Baby
Jenny that we shall never forget you. You
will hear from me again very soon.”</p>
</div>

<p>“How kind of him!” murmured Mrs.
Bobbsey.</p>

<p>“Did Baby May—I mean Baby Jenny—write
a letter?” asked Freddie.</p>

<p>“No, she is hardly old enough,” answered
his mother, while Mr. Bobbsey began lifting
out the bunches of early vegetables and the
boxes of berries. It was the green, red, and
yellow color of the fruits and vegetables which
the children had glimpsed through cracks in
the box. So quickly had the farm and garden
produce come by express that they were very
fresh and good.</p>

<p>“I guess we’ll not have any of these for
supper,” announced Mr. Bobbsey, as he
reached down and rubbed Snoop, who was
now purring happily since he was out of the
prison into which he had crawled. “And,
speaking of supper, I am ready to eat mine.”</p>

<p>“We’re going to have pie,” declared Bert.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
“I saw Dinah baking them, and I guess she
made some extra ones on account of your
birthday, Daddy.”</p>

<p>“Did she? That’s nice!” laughed Mr.
Bobbsey. “You must have been in the kitchen
to find out about the pies, Bert.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, I was,” admitted Bert, with a
quick look at Nan. But she seemed to be
thinking of something else.</p>

<p>“Come now, children, we will eat and then
we’ll unpack the vegetables from Cloverbank,”
suggested Mrs. Bobbsey. “What a
pretty name for a place,” she went on. “It
must be a delightful country up there.”</p>

<p>“I wish we could go to the country again,”
said Bert. “School will soon be over and
we’ll have a long vacation.”</p>

<p>“Where are we going this vacation?” asked
Nan.</p>

<p>“We haven’t decided yet,” answered her
mother. “But come—we shall be late for
supper unless we hurry, and that makes more
work for Dinah!”</p>

<p>She led the way to the dining room, with
Flossie and Freddie whispering on the way:</p>

<p>“When can we give Daddy his presents?”</p>

<p>“You might as well get them now, I suppose,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
said Mrs. Bobbsey, with a laugh as
she glanced at her husband. “There will be
no peace at the table until you do, and you
won’t eat anything until this excitement is
over. Get the presents now!”</p>

<p>“Whoopee!” yelled Bert, who was almost
as excited as were the smaller twins.</p>

<p>“Mine’s in the cellar!” cried Freddie, as he
made a dash for the kitchen.</p>

<p>“Be careful going down the stairs!” warned
his mother.</p>

<p>“Mine’s upstairs,” remarked Nan.</p>

<p>“So’s mine!” added Bert, with a quick
look at her. “I didn’t see you up there
hiding it, though,” he went on.</p>

<p>“And I didn’t see you,” laughed Nan. “I
came in through the kitchen.”</p>

<p>“So’d I!” cried Bert, with a chuckle.</p>

<p>“I did, too!” added Flossie. “And my
present’s under the front stairs in the little
dark closet. Don’t you look until I get it
for you, Daddy!” she warned. “Don’t
peek, will you?”</p>

<p>“All right, I won’t!” promised Mr. Bobbsey.
“See, my eyes are tight shut—you’ll
have to lead me to the table, Mother,” he
went on to his wife.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, isn’t this fun!” laughed Flossie, as the
children scattered to get the birthday presents
from the various hiding places.</p>

<p>“Well, whut’s gwine on now?” demanded
Dinah, as she saw Freddie dash through the
kitchen and down the cellar stairs.</p>

<p>“It’s time for the secret!” he breathlessly
explained.</p>

<p>“Well, Ah suah am glad ob dat!” chuckled
the colored cook. “Mah nice supper am
’bout ruined wif all dis delay!”</p>

<p>They were soon all gathered about the
table, Mr. Bobbsey still with his eyes tightly
shut. One after the other, the twins walked
up and put their presents in front of him. Not
until all four packages were there did Mrs.
Bobbsey call:</p>

<p>“Ready! Open your eyes!”</p>

<p>When he opened them and saw the packages,
Mr. Bobbsey pretended that he had
suddenly awakened, and was still dreaming.
He rubbed his eyes and said:</p>

<p>“There must be some mistake!”</p>

<p>“What mistake, Daddy?” asked Nan.</p>

<p>“Why, all these presents!” was the answer.
“I have only <i>one</i> birthday, but there are <i>four</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
presents! I’d better send three of them
back!”</p>

<p>“No! No!”</p>

<p>“They’re all for you!”</p>

<p>“Every one!”</p>

<p>“They’re all yours—all four!”</p>

<p>Thus cried the Bobbsey twins in joyous
excitement. Of course Mr. Bobbsey knew
that all the while; but he did love to tease the
twins. Then he took up first the big bundle
which Freddie had hidden down in the cellar.</p>

<p>“Oh, what lovely flowers!” cried the birthday
man. “Oh, how I love flowers!” and he
buried his nose in them.</p>

<p>“I picked ’em—every one!” cried Freddie,
in great delight. “And there’s something
else in there, too, Daddy! Down in the
bottom! Look!”</p>

<p>“Well, I declare. A baseball! Of all
things!” exclaimed Mr. Bobbsey as he took
it out. “That’s just what I’ve been wanting—a
baseball so I could have a little game at
noon with the men in the lumberyard. It’s
a fine ball, too—and such a bouncer!” he went
on, as he threw it to the floor and caught it as
it rebounded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span></p>

<p>“And if you don’t want it—or if you get
tired of it,” said Freddie, “why, you can
give it to me. Sammie Shull and I are going
to get up a baseball nine.”</p>

<p>“All right,” his father said. “If I find it’s
too small for me and the men—and it looks
as if it might be too small—you may take it,
Freddie.”</p>

<p>“Yes—that’s what I thought,” said the lad,
while his father and mother smiled at each
other.</p>

<p>“That’s my present to you,” said Flossie,
pointing to the square box she had hidden in
the stair closet. “I hope you’ll like it.”</p>

<p>Mr. Bobbsey took out the folding doll go-cart.
First there was a puzzled look on his
face. Then he smiled as he cried:</p>

<p>“Oh, I see, this is a new kind of necktie!”</p>

<p>“No, it isn’t!” protested Flossie.</p>

<p>“Then it must be an umbrella to keep off
the rain,” went on the lumber merchant, pretending
to be puzzled about the folding go-cart,
though, all the while, he knew what it
was.</p>

<p>“Oh, no, Daddy! ’Tisn’t an umbrella!”
cried Flossie. “It’s a little carriage for my
doll. You unfold it and bend out the wheels.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
Then, when you take me for a walk and I get
tired of carrying my doll, you can put it in
the go-cart and wheel her for me. I think
that’s a nice present for you—isn’t it,
Daddy?”</p>

<p>“It’s the most beautiful present I ever
got!” declared her father, with a laugh, “and
I’m going to give you a kiss for it. I must
also kiss Freddie for the baseball. That was
a fine present, too! That is, unless my little
fireman is too big to be kissed?” and Mr.
Bobbsey looked at Freddie a moment after he
had kissed Flossie.</p>

<p>“I don’t mind being kissed—on your birthday,”
said the little fellow. “But not much
at other times. I’m getting too big for it.”</p>

<p>“So you are,” said Mr. Bobbsey, with a
laugh. “Well, bring in your doll, Flossie,
and let’s see how she fits my new folding
birthday go-cart,” and again Mr. and Mrs.
Bobbsey laughed at each other.</p>

<p>The doll had been put in and wheeled
about. But there were still two packages to
be opened—those which Nan and Bert had
put beside their father’s plate.</p>

<p>These gifts were not quite as “’riginal” as
those Flossie and Freddie had bought, for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
the older twins had asked their mother what
she thought their father would like. With
the help of her mother Nan had bought Mr.
Bobbsey a bathrobe which, he said, was just
what he had long needed. Bert’s present was
a golf sweater which, his father stated, was
just the color he had long been hoping to get.</p>

<p>“This is the best birthday I ever remember!”
declared Mr. Bobbsey, when his wife
had presented him with a new wallet in which
to carry his money, cards, and papers.
“What with the flowers, the baseball, the
go-cart, the robe, the sweater, the wallet, and
the box of fruits and vegetables from Cloverbank—why,
I never got so many things before!”</p>

<p>It was a jolly birthday celebration, and the
children talked of little else while the meal
was going on. Presently Nan turned the
conversation another way by asking:</p>

<p>“What do you suppose Mr. Watson meant
by saying you would soon hear from him
again, Daddy?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know, my dear, unless he meant
that he would write now and again to let us
hear how the baby was getting along,” was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>the answer. “You know, we grew very fond
of Baby May, as we called her, and your
mother and I did not want to give her up,
though of course we had to. I think Mr.
Watson must mean he is going to write again
to tell us about Baby Jenny, as we must learn
to call her.”</p>

<p>But a letter came from Cloverbank before
any of the Bobbseys thought it possible to
receive one. Just as supper was finished
there came a ring at the doorbell, and Flossie
cried:</p>

<p>“Oh, maybe it’s more presents for Daddy’s
birthday.”</p>

<p>Instead of an expressman, however, it
proved to be a boy from the post-office with
a special delivery letter. These letters come
at any time of the day or night, after the
regular mail is delivered.</p>

<p>“A special delivery!” murmured Mrs.
Bobbsey, as she saw the blue stamp with the
picture on it of a messenger boy running. “I
wonder who it is from?”</p>

<p>“It’s easy to tell that even without opening
it,” said Mr. Bobbsey. “It’s from Henry
Watson of Cloverbank. His name is on the
envelope.”</p>

<p>“Oh, he said you’d hear from him again<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
soon, and you have!” cried Nan. “Do open
it, Daddy, and see what it’s about.”</p>

<p>When Mr. Bobbsey read the letter a smile
came to his face.</p>

<p>“Well, this seems to settle the summer vacation
problem for us, Mother!” he exclaimed.
“This is an invitation from Mr. and Mrs.
Watson and also from Baby May—I mean
Baby Jenny—to come and spend the summer
with them at Cloverbank. Among other
things, Mr. Watson writes:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“‘Can’t you and the children visit us?
Baby “May” would surely love to see the
Bobbsey twins.’”</p>
</div>

<p>“Oh, can we go?” chorused the Bobbsey
twins.</p>

<p>But before either Mr. or Mrs. Bobbsey
could answer there sounded a loud crash out
in the kitchen, and the voice of Dinah cried:</p>

<p>“Dar! Now luck whut yo’ all done!
Mah goodness!”</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV</h2>
</div>

<p class="ph3">THE PRIZE OFFER</p>


<p>Silence followed the crash and the excited
call of Dinah. Mrs. Bobbsey thought something
serious might have happened, and she
said to her husband:</p>

<p>“Perhaps you had better go to see what it
is.”</p>

<p>That it was nothing serious was made plain
a moment later, even before Mr. Bobbsey
reached the place, for Dinah could be heard
laughing, and between her chuckles came the
voice of Sam Johnson, her husband, complaining:</p>

<p>“Git offen me now! Does yo’ heah? Git
offen mah haid! Mah good lan’, such goin’s
on as dere am heah! Git off, Ah tells yo’!”</p>

<p>When the Bobbseys entered the kitchen
they saw Sam dancing around and trying to
reach something on his head. This something<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
proved to be Snoop, the big black cat, who
was clinging with his claws to Sam’s thick,
kinky, black, woolly hair.</p>

<p>“Snoop suah does know when he’s got a
soft place!” chuckled Dinah, who was laughing
so hard that she could not go to the aid
of her husband.</p>

<p>“Take him offen me! Take him off, Ah
tells yo’!” begged Sam, dancing about the
kitchen.</p>

<p>“I’ll get him,” offered Nan, who had
trained Snoop to do a few tricks. “Stand
still, Sam,” begged the little girl, “and I’ll
get Snoop off for you! How’d he get on your
head?”</p>

<p>“He done jumped there—dat’s how he
got,” explained Sam, with a rueful face as he
did what Nan advised and remained in one
spot. Then the little girl brought a chair
over close to the colored man-of-all-work, and,
climbing up, lifted Snoop down. As soon as
the cat felt himself in the hands of Nan, the
animal released his claws from their firm hold
in Sam’s wool. It was this grip of the cat’s
claws that had prevented Sam himself from
lifting Snoop down. The more he pulled on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
the animal the tighter Snoop clung, for he
was afraid of falling.</p>

<p>“What happened, Dinah?” asked Mrs.
Bobbsey, who, with her husband, stood in
the kitchen doorway, laughing at Sam’s rueful
face.</p>

<p>“Oh, I guess dat cat Snoop mus’ ’a’ had a
birfday himse’f,” explained Dinah. “He’s
dat smart an’ libely he mus’ feel laik he’s
about one yeah old—jumpin’ ’round laik he
was.”</p>

<p>“What did he do?” asked Bert.</p>

<p>“Oh, he jump up on a chair when I wasn’t
lookin’!” went on Dinah. “An’ his tail
knock a dish offen de table an’ bruk it—bruk
de dish Ah means. Den I grabbed up
de broom to make a swoop at Snoop an’ just
den Sam come in an’ I hit him ’stid ob hittin’
de cat. An’ dat scared Snoop, I guess,
’cause he make a jump an’ he git right up on
top ob de do’ and den—den——”</p>

<p>But Dinah was laughing so heartily at the
recollection of what had happened that she
could not go on with the story. So Sam continued
it by adding:</p>

<p>“Dat cat he jes’ jump right down offen de<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
do’ right on top ob mah haid, an’ dar he
stuck laik a chestnut burr! Golly, but he
suah did stick his claws in mah ha’r!” and
then Sam chuckled.</p>

<p>“Well, I’m glad it was no worse,” remarked
Mrs. Bobbsey, with a smile. “One broken
dish doesn’t matter, especially on a birthday.
But perhaps you had better take Snoop out,
Nan, so he won’t make any more trouble for
Dinah.”</p>

<p>“I’ll give him a ride in Flossie’s doll’s go-cart
that she got for Daddy!” laughed Nan.</p>

<p>“No, you will not!” protested the other
Bobbsey girl. “I’m going to give my doll a
ride. Come on, Daddy,” she begged. “Let’s
take a walk and ride my doll.”</p>

<p>“And let’s have a catch with my ball—I
mean the ball I gave you!” cried Freddie.</p>

<p>“Maybe I’d better put on my new robe
and wear my new birthday sweater before I
go doll-carriaging and ball-playing,” suggested
Mr. Bobbsey, with a laugh.</p>

<p>“Well, don’t take the new wallet I gave
you,” warned his wife. “I put a penny in,
for luck, and you might lose it.”</p>

<p>But after again admiring the robe and the
sweater, the gifts of Bert and Nan, Mr.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
Bobbsey laid them aside and had a few
catches with Freddie, using the new ball.
Then he wheeled Flossie’s folding go-cart,
giving the little girl’s best doll a ride.</p>

<p>After that the four twins went off by themselves
to play with some of their boy and girl
chums in the twilight of the fading June day,
while Mr. and Mrs. Bobbsey sat on the porch.</p>

<p>“Do you really think,” asked Mrs. Bobbsey
of her husband, “that you will take the
children to Cloverbank for the summer?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” he answered. “What do
you think? Mr. Watson seems to want to
have us come. I know he has a large place
there with plenty of room in the house, and
there is a big farm, an orchard, and woods
near by where the twins could play. There
is also a creek and a little lake, I believe.”</p>

<p>“It sounds like a wonderful place to spend
the summer,” responded his wife. “And we
always go somewhere. Just where is Cloverbank?”</p>

<p>“It is outside the town of Hitchville,” was
the answer. “It’s about a day’s ride in the
automobile. We could get there without
much trouble.”</p>

<p>“Well, if you think they really want us,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
suppose you write and tell Mr. Watson if he
will take the whole family for the summer
we’ll be glad to come,” suggested Mrs. Bobbsey.</p>

<p>“I know the children will like it,” remarked
their father.</p>

<p>Twilight faded into darkness and, tired
with their evening of play, the Bobbsey twins
came slowly back home. Soon Flossie and
Freddie were undressed and in bed, with Bert
and Nan getting ready to follow them a
little later. But first the two older twins
wanted to know more about the plans for the
summer.</p>

<p>“We have about decided to go to Cloverbank,”
said Mrs. Bobbsey.</p>

<p>“Oh, goodie!” exclaimed Nan. “Then I
can take out Baby May—I mean Baby
Jenny.”</p>

<p>“I hope there’s a place where I can swim
and catch fish,” murmured Bert.</p>

<p>“Are you going to swim after the fish and
catch them?” asked Nan, with a laugh.</p>

<p>“Oh, you know what I mean,” he answered.
“I can’t do both at the same time, of course.
Though once, when Danny Rugg and I were
in swimming, a fish brushed its tail against<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
my legs and I almost caught it, only I wasn’t
quick enough.”</p>

<p>“I think there will be plenty of swimming,
fishing, and other fun at Mr. Watson’s
Cloverbank place,” said Mr. Bobbsey.
“And now I think you and Nan had better
see which of you will be first asleep,” he went
on, for it was getting late. Supper had been
delayed longer than usual because of the
birthday celebration, and the children had
been allowed to stay up a little later than
was customary.</p>

<p>“Oh, won’t we have fun in Cloverbank!”
whispered Nan to her brother, as they went
up the stairs.</p>

<p>“I just guess we will!” he answered. “I
can hardly wait for the time to come!”</p>

<p>“Me either. Good-night!”</p>

<p>“Good-night!” answered Bert, as he went
softly into the room where he slept with
Freddie. Nan slept with Flossie. Both the
small twins were sound asleep. So were Bert
and Nan a little later.</p>

<p>School had not yet closed for the summer.
There was about another week of classes before
the long vacation. And the morning
after their father’s birthday the Bobbsey<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
twins started for the schoolhouse soon after
the first bell began ringing.</p>

<p>“Hello, Danny!” called Bert when he saw
the Rugg boy coming up the street. “Don’t
you wish you had another snowball to break
a church window with?” and Bert laughed as
he recalled what had happened in the winter,
when Danny had broken a stained-glass
window and had blamed Bert for it. But the
truth had come out, through the loss of
Danny’s gold ring, and Danny had begged
Bert’s pardon, so the boys were good friends
once more.</p>

<p>“Yes, a pile of snow would feel good just
about now,” agreed Danny. “It sure is a
hot day! I’ll be glad when school closes.”</p>

<p>“So’ll I,” assented Bert. “Where you going
this summer?”</p>

<p>“Down to the seashore, I guess,” Danny
answered.</p>

<p>“We’re going to the country,” went on
Bert. “To a place called Cloverbank. It’s
near Hitchville.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s a swell place!” cried Danny.
“I know a fellow who went there. There’s
dandy fishing in the creek!”</p>

<p>“I’m glad of it,” said Bert. Then the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
boys and girls passed into the schoolhouse.
I cannot say that any one was much interested
in lessons that day. It was too hot to study
much. Realizing this, the teacher in the
room where Bert and Nan sat had an idea.
She was trying to get the children to write a
“composition,” which, as most of you know,
isn’t easy work.</p>

<p>“You children will find it much easier to
write compositions,” Miss Skell said, “if
you will take as subjects something you know
about. Instead of trying to write about the
stars, as some of you did last week, try to
write about something on earth. You don’t
know much about the stars—no one does.
But you may know a great deal about a nest
that some birds have built in your apple tree.
So write about those birds.</p>

<p>“And while I am talking about compositions,”
the teacher went on, “I want to say
that I am going to offer a prize to the boy or
girl who, during the vacation, will write the
best story, or composition, about something
that happens to him or her this summer.
Write about something real, in the best way
you can, and bring the story back to school
when it opens again in the fall.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span></p>

<p>“The best compositions will be read before
the class, and I will decide who is to get the
prize, which will be a set of books. The
winner may choose the books from a list I will
have on my desk.”</p>

<p>Murmurs of delight and surprise were heard
about the room. This was something new—a
prize for a summer composition! At once
the children, who had been dull and listless
because of the heat, seemed bright and cheerful.
Miss Skell smiled at the success of her
plan.</p>

<p>“Now we will have some practice work in
writing compositions,” she went on. “You
will be better able to do the work this summer
when there is no school if you practice a bit
now. So we will begin!”</p>

<p>Every boy and girl was most eager now, especially
Nan Bobbsey. She was always good
at composition work—perhaps not the best
in the room, but certainly better than Bert,
though he tried. But, really, Bert cared
more about playing games than about writing
compositions.</p>

<p>“Oh, if I could only win that prize!”
thought Nan. “It would be wonderful! I
wonder what I can find to write about? Perhaps<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
something may happen while we are at
Cloverbank.”</p>

<p>Danny Rugg raised his hand, indicating
that he wanted to ask a question.</p>

<p>“What is it, Danny?” inquired the teacher.</p>

<p>“How long must the composition be?” the
boy asked. “I mean how many pages?”</p>

<p>“Oh, as many as you like,” was the reply.
“But it must not be too short!” went on Miss
Skell quickly. “I want more than a few sentences.
Try to make a story about what
happens to you this summer—a story such
as you might read in a book. Who knows—perhaps
some of you, when you grow up, may
write books. I hope you will.”</p>

<p>“I’d love to write a book!” murmured Nan
to Nellie Parks, who sat with her.</p>

<p>“I’d rather read books than write them,”
whispered Nellie.</p>

<p>“Quiet now, children, if you please,” suggested
Miss Skell, for she had allowed a little
whispering following her announcement of
the prize offer. “Now we will begin our
composition work. You may each write me
a short one on the subject of what happened
to you yesterday after school—in the afternoon,
evening, or night!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span></p>

<p>Just as Bert Bobbsey was settling himself
to his task, the door opened and a girl from
one of the higher classes entered with a note
which she gave to Miss Skell. The teacher
read it quickly, and then said in a low voice:</p>

<p>“Mr. Tarton wants to see you in his office,
Bert.”</p>

<p>What could this mean? Mr. Tarton was
the principal of the school. Usually it was
not very pleasant to have to go to his office.</p>

<p>Bert slowly left his seat. He, too, was
wondering what could have happened.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V</h2>
</div>

<p class="ph3">OFF FOR CLOVERBANK</p>


<p>Nan Bobbsey and some of her girl chums,
as well as Danny Rugg and the boys with
whom Bert Bobbsey played, also wondered
why Bert had to go to the principal’s office.</p>

<p>“Did Bert do anything?” whispered Grace
Lavine, who sat behind Nan.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” was the low-voiced reply.
“I don’t think so. I didn’t see him.”</p>

<p>“Well, anyhow, he couldn’t have thrown
any snowballs,” said Nellie Parks. “I mean
like the time he once did and Danny said he
broke the church window.”</p>

<p>“No,” agreed Nan, remembering the winter
when she and her brother and the smaller
twins “kept house,” with Mrs. Pry ill in bed.</p>

<p>“Was Bert fighting with any of the fellows?”
inquired Charlie Mason of Danny,
who sat near him. “Mr. Tarton doesn’t like
fighting.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span></p>

<p>“I know he doesn’t,” Danny answered.
“But I don’t believe Bert was. It must be
for something else.”</p>

<p>“Attend to your lessons now, children.
Bert will be back soon,” said Miss Skell.</p>

<p>Nan gave a sigh of relief on hearing this.
It could not be so very serious, then.</p>

<p>As for Bert, his heart was beating rather
faster than usual as he entered Mr. Tarton’s
office, but the smile with which the head of
the school greeted the pupil seemed to tell the
boy that he was not brought down for anything
serious.</p>

<p>“Good-morning, Bert!” said the principal.
“I called you here to see if you have a top
in your pocket—you know what I mean—a
top that spins with a string wound around it.
Have you such a top?”</p>

<p>“Why—er—yes—yes, sir,” stammered the
boy. What in the world could Mr. Tarton
want of a top? Could he have turned childish
and have a desire to play with a top in
his office, Bert wondered.</p>

<p>Then another thought came into the mind
of the lad. Perhaps Mr. Tarton thought
Bert had been playing with a top during class
time. So the boy said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span></p>

<p>“But I didn’t have it out in the room, Mr.
Tarton! Really I didn’t! I was spinning it
in front of the school, but I put it in my
pocket when I came in and——”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know you did, Bert,” and again
Mr. Tarton smiled. “I saw you spinning your
top, and that’s why I sent for you. I want
you to come and spin the top for me in front
of the class in science.”</p>

<p>This was more and more puzzling.</p>

<p>The principal must have seen that Burt
was puzzled and a bit worried, for he laughed
a little and said:</p>

<p>“It’s all right, Bert. The science class is
studying motion, and I want to illustrate to
them the principle of the gyroscope. I have
that kind of a top here, but I had no common
top, and I remembered seeing you spin yours,
and that it was a large red one, which can
easily be seen when you spin it on the platform
in front of the high-school class. You
see I want to show the science boys and girls
the difference between a gyroscope top and
the common top.”</p>

<p>“And you want me to spin a top in school—for
a lesson?” asked Bert in surprise.</p>

<p>“That’s it—yes,” answered the principal.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
“I think you know what a gyroscope top is,
don’t you?” Bert did, having been given one
for Christmas. Mr. Tarton quickly brought
his queer top out and spun it.</p>

<p>A gyroscope top is a heavy, small wheel
fitted inside a round ring of metal, and the
ring has a sort of top peg on it. When the
heavy wheel inside the metal ring is set spinning
by means of a string wound about it
and pulled off, the wheel goes so fast that it
will hold up the metal ring in any position.
Thus the gyroscope top will spin upside down,
lying on its side and in many other positions.</p>

<p>“But your top will spin in one way only,
and that is standing straight up, Bert,” said
the principal. “That’s what I want the boys
and girls in the high-school class to understand.
Of course I could tell them about it,
but they will learn much more quickly if they
see the two different tops spinning in front
of them. So come with me now, if you
please, and bring your top.”</p>

<p>Bert could hardly help smiling as he followed
the principal to the high-school part
of the building. It seemed so queer to be
asked, as a favor, to spin a top in class. But
the older boys and girls were as much in earnest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
as was Mr. Tarton. They wanted to
learn this rule about spinning bodies, for the
earth we live on, you know, spins about like
a giant top. So the high-school lads and
lassies did not laugh when Mr. Tarton wound
up and spun the gyroscope nor when Bert
set his red top to spinning. They asked
many questions and seemed eager to learn.
Bert himself was much interested.</p>

<p>“You are a good top-spinner,” said Mr.
Tarton to him when the lesson was over.
“You may go back to your class, and you
may take the gyroscope top with you and
tell Miss Skell I said you could spin it and
show the smaller boys and girls how it
works.”</p>

<p>So the mystery of why Bert was sent to
the principal’s office was soon solved. Going
back to his room, in a few words Bert told
Miss Skell about it. He also delivered the
message about the gyroscope, and soon the
boys and girls were much interested in watching
Bert spin it on Miss Skell’s desk.</p>

<p>“If she’d let us write a composition about
that funny top I believe I could do a good
one,” said Nellie Parks to Nan when the class
was let out for the noon recess.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span></p>

<p>“But the prize composition must be about
something that happens on our summer vacation,”
answered Nan. “Oh, I do hope I
win the prize!”</p>

<p>“I hope you do, too,” said Nellie generously.
“There’s no use in me hoping for it.
I never can write a decent composition. But
I hope you win, Nan!”</p>

<p>“Thanks,” replied Bert’s sister.</p>

<p>On the way home Nan told her brother how
worried she had been when he was sent to the
principal’s office.</p>

<p>“I was worried myself, at first,” Bert admitted.
“But I had to laugh when he asked
me to spin the top.”</p>

<p>“I wish Mr. Tarton would send for me and
ask me to turn somersaults in class!” laughed
Freddie, when he heard his older brother and
sister talking about what had happened. “I
can do them fine—look!”</p>

<p>And on the grass at the edge of the sidewalk
he flopped down and turned three somersaults
one after the other.</p>

<p>“Good!” cried Bert.</p>

<p>“I can do that, too!” declared Flossie.
“Want to see me?”</p>

<p>“No! No!” objected Nan. “You mustn’t!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
Not here on the street! You’re a girl and
Freddie is a boy—that’s different!”</p>

<p>“Well, I can turn somersaults as good as
he can!” declared Flossie.</p>

<p>But by this time they were nearly home,
and as Flossie was eager to see what Dinah
had for lunch she ran on ahead, forgetting
about the somersaults.</p>

<p>Around the lunch table that noon Bert
told about the spinning tops, and Nan spoke
of Miss Skell’s offer of a prize for the best
composition on the summer vacation happenings.</p>

<p>“Mother, do you think anything will happen
when we get to Cloverbank?” asked the
little girl eagerly.</p>

<p>“Many things may happen,” was the answer.
“I hope they will all be happy happenings,
though; for you can just as well write
about them as about sad ones, I should
think.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes!” agreed Nan. “I want them to
be happy and funny.”</p>

<p>The end of the school term was coming.
By Thursday the last examinations would
be over and then would come the closing
session.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span></p>

<p>It was all settled about the Bobbsey twins
going to Cloverbank. Mr. Bobbsey had
written to Mr. Watson, thanking him, his
wife, and also “Baby May,” for the kind invitation
to come to spend the summer on the
big country place.</p>

<p>“We will drive to Hitchville in the automobile,”
Mr. Bobbsey said, in talking over
the plans. “Cloverbank is the name of Mr.
Watson’s farm, and it is just outside Hitchville.”</p>

<p>“Will Dinah and Sam come with us?”
asked Flossie, for she loved the dear old
colored couple who had so long looked after
the children.</p>

<p>“No, Sam and Dinah are going to have a
vacation, too,” Mrs. Bobbsey answered.</p>

<p>“Are we going to take Snoop and Snap?”
asked Freddie, as he looked at the dog and
the cat who were playing together out in the
yard. The two were great friends.</p>

<p>“I fancy there will be many animals on
Mr. Watson’s farm, so there will be no need
to take Snap and Snoop,” Mrs. Bobbsey replied.
“We will send our dog and cat away
to be boarded for the summer as we have done
before.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span></p>

<p>“Well, I’m going to take my fishing pole,
anyhow,” declared Bert.</p>

<p>“And I’m going to take my toy fire engine,”
declared Freddie. “The farmhouse
might catch fire and I could put it out.”</p>

<p>“Don’t take too many toys,” warned his
mother. “Your engine is all right, and Flossie
may take one of her dolls. But we haven’t
room for all your things.”</p>

<p>It was not easy for the two smaller twins
to leave their many playthings behind, and
Flossie could hardly decide which of her many
dolls she wanted with her. But at last the
choices were made, Bert and Nan took what
they wanted (Nan’s choice was a book or
two) and finally everything was packed ready
to leave.</p>

<p>The last day of school came. Good-bye
messages were exchanged and pupils and
teachers separated to meet again in the fall,
which now seemed a long way off.</p>

<p>“Don’t forget about the prize composition!”
called Miss Skell to her pupils.</p>

<p>“We’ll remember!” promised Nan.</p>

<p>The Bobbsey twins could hardly wait for
the hours to pass until they should be in the
car and on the road to Hitchville. But at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
last the house was closed. Snap and Snoop
had been sent away, not without many farewells
on the part of Flossie and Freddie.
Sam and Dinah had departed to visit relatives.
Then away from Lakeport rolled the
Bobbsey family.</p>

<p>“I hope a lot of things happen before we
get back,” remarked Nan to her mother. “I
want them to put in my composition.”</p>

<p>It was a pleasant day for the start of the
trip. Mr. Bobbsey expected to reach Hitchville
early in the evening.</p>

<p>Most of the morning had passed and they
had covered nearly a hundred miles of the
journey when came a question which was
always asked, sooner or later, on all the trips
the Bobbseys took.</p>

<p>“When do we eat?” demanded Freddie,
about eleven o’clock.</p>

<p>“Why, you aren’t hungry now, are you?”
inquired his mother.</p>

<p>“Sure I am,” he said. “I can eat a lot.
And I wish I had a drink of milk.”</p>

<p>“We didn’t bring any milk along,” said
Mrs. Bobbsey. “I was afraid it would sour,
the weather is so warm.”</p>

<p>“I fancy we can get some milk to drink<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
with our lunch at that farmhouse,” said Mr.
Bobbsey, pointing to one a short distance
ahead. “I see cows in the field back of it, and
they must sell milk. We’ll stop and inquire.”</p>

<p>A basket of Dinah’s best lunch had been
put up to eat on the trip, and milk would
make a welcome addition to it, Mrs. Bobbsey
thought. Her husband was right in his guess
about the farmhouse. When the auto
stopped there the lady said they would be
glad to sell as much milk as the children could
drink.</p>

<p>“Bring your lunch in and eat it under the
trees in the yard,” she invited. “It’s cool
and shady there. I’ll bring the milk up from
the cellar.”</p>

<p>“It will be nice to get out of the car for a
change,” said Mrs. Bobbsey, and soon there
was a jolly little picnic party under the trees
in front of the old-fashioned farmhouse.</p>

<p>The children would have been pleased to
stay there most of the afternoon, to look
about the place, but when lunch was over and
each of the twins had had two glasses of milk,
Mr. Bobbsey suggested that they had better
travel on, as he did not want to arrive in
Hitchville after dark.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span></p>

<p>Back into the car they climbed, and with
many thanks to the good-natured farm lady,
once more they were on their way. Flossie
and Freddie were quieter now, as they always
were after lunch, and even Bert and Nan did
not talk as much as they had during the first
part of the trip.</p>

<p>But soon the quiet of the journey was
broken by Mrs. Bobbsey, who gave a little
jump. Their mother was sitting in the rear
with Flossie and Freddie. She exclaimed:</p>

<p>“There’s something in this car!”</p>

<p>“Why, of course there is!” laughed her
husband. “The whole Bobbsey family is
in it!”</p>

<p>“No, I mean something else—something
extra! Some kind of an animal!” insisted his
wife. “I can feel it moving around my feet!
Listen! What is it? Stop the car, Dick!
There is some animal in it!”</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI</h2>
</div>

<p class="ph3">THE LONELY CABIN</p>


<p>Mrs. Bobbsey’s voice showed that she
was in earnest, so her husband lost no time
in guiding the car to the side of the road, to
be out of the way of passing autoists, and
then he brought it to a quick stop with a
grinding and squeaking of the brakes.</p>

<p>“Now what is it?” he asked, turning back
to look at his wife.</p>

<p>“I said there was some strange animal—maybe
more than one of them—in our car!”</p>

<p>“How could there be?” asked Mr. Bobbsey
with a laugh. “That is, unless you call the
twins animals, and they are—in a way.”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t mean them,” answered his
wife. “Oh!” she gave a little scream.
“They’re crawling around my feet. And
listen to them!”</p>

<p>Now that it was quiet, Mr. Bobbsey, too,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
could hear a faint whimpering sound. By
this time Flossie and Freddie, who had dozed
off into a sleepy little nap after lunch, awakened.
They sat up, rubbed their eyes, and
Flossie cried:</p>

<p>“What we stopping for? Are we at Cloverbank?
I don’t see any clover or any bank,
either!”</p>

<p>“We stopped because your mother thought
she felt and heard some kind of an animal in
the car,” explained Mr. Bobbsey, who did
not know quite what it was all about, for he
could see nothing as he looked over into the
rear of the machine. But that he could see
nothing was not to be wondered at, for the
space was piled with luggage, robes, and
things the children had brought with them,
so there was scarcely room for Mrs. Bobbsey
and the two small twins.</p>

<p>“I didn’t <i>think</i> I felt or heard something!”
said the children’s mother in firm tones. “I
<i>felt</i> something and <i>heard</i> something, and I feel
it now! What is it?”</p>

<p>Then Freddie spoke up and said:</p>

<p>“I guess maybe it’s the kittens!”</p>

<p>“Yes,” agreed Flossie, with a little smile.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
“It must be the kittens you feel, Mother.
And I can hear them mewing now. Can’t
you hear the kittens mewing, Freddie?”</p>

<p>“Sure I can!” was the reply.</p>

<p>“Kittens? Kittens? What kittens?”
asked Mrs. Bobbsey.</p>

<p>“It’s the five little kittens Flossie and I
put in a box and brought along with us,” explained
Freddie. “I guess they got out and
it’s them crawling over your feet, Mother.”</p>

<p>“Five kitties can mew a whole lot,” added
Flossie.</p>

<p>“Five kittens! What in the world do the
children mean?” cried Mrs. Bobbsey. She
reached down into the midst of the baggage
and other things and brought up a pasteboard
box containing one lonely little kitten.</p>

<p>“I guess the other four are crawling around
down there,” said Freddie calmly. “There
were five of them; weren’t there, Flossie?”</p>

<p>“Yes, five,” answered the little girl.</p>

<p>“I can feel them!” sighed Mrs. Bobbsey.
“Oh, my goodness!” She reached down
again, and one at a time, brought up four
more kittens from the bottom of the car.
She put them in the box with the other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, aren’t they cute!” cried Nan.</p>

<p>“One’s almost as black as Snoop!” said
Bert.</p>

<p>“Where in the world did you children get
these kittens?” asked their mother.</p>

<p>“Back at the farmhouse,” replied Freddie.
“We thought we better have some animals
to take out to Cloverbank in case Mr. Watson
hasn’t any, so Flossie and I put these five
kittens in the box and put them in our car.”</p>

<p>“There were six,” added Flossie; “but we
left one with the mother cat so she wouldn’t
be lonesome.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean you youngsters packed
these cats up back at the farmhouse where
we got the milk?” asked Mr. Bobbsey.</p>

<p>“Yes, Daddy,” assented Freddie. “We
did.”</p>

<p>“But don’t you know that was a wrong
thing to do?” reproved his mother. “These
kittens weren’t yours to take. They belong
to some one at the farm where they were so
kind to us.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Flossie calmly. “They
belong to the red-haired boy there. I asked
him if the kittens were his and he said they
were. Then Freddie asked him if we could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
have them and he said we could. Didn’t he,
Freddie?”</p>

<p>“That’s what he did,” was the answer.
“So we took them.”</p>

<p>“Well, I should say you did!” and now
Mrs. Bobbsey could not help laughing. “But
why didn’t you ask me if you could do this?”</p>

<p>“We—now—we didn’t want to bother you,
because you always have so much to think
about when we go on vacations,” explained
Freddie.</p>

<p>“So we just took the kittens,” added his
sister.</p>

<p>“Um! Yes! Well, we’ll have to take
them right back,” said Mr. Bobbsey. “Perhaps
that red-haired boy didn’t know what
he was talking about, children, when he said
you could have the kittens. They may not
have been his to give away, and the farmer
or his wife may want them to catch mice in
the barn. Yes, we must take the kittens
back!”</p>

<p>“Oh, couldn’t we please keep just one?”
begged Flossie.</p>

<p>“The little black one that looks like
Snoop!” pleaded Freddie.</p>

<p>But both Mr. and Mrs. Bobbsey were firm—the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
kittens must go back where they came
from.</p>

<p>“Though it will delay you to turn about
and go to the farm, won’t it?” Mrs. Bobbsey
asked her husband.</p>

<p>“A little,” he replied. “But it cannot be
helped. However, the roads are good and
we can make a little faster time the remainder
of the day. I wish we didn’t have to, but I
feel that it is the best thing to do—take the
kittens back.”</p>

<p>Flossie and Freddie felt a bit sad over this,
and even Bert and Nan would have liked one
of the pets. But they thought their father
and mother knew best.</p>

<p>“Very likely Mr. Watson will have plenty
of animals at Cloverbank,” said Mrs. Bobbsey,
to console the sorrowing small twins.</p>

<p>“And, anyhow, there’s the baby,” said Nan.</p>

<p>“That’s so,” agreed Flossie. “I guess
maybe it’s better that we don’t keep the
kittens, Freddie. They might mew in the
night and wake up Baby May—I mean Baby
Jenny.”</p>

<p>“I guess so,” assented her twin brother.</p>

<p>So the auto was turned about and the return
trip made in good time. The farm lady<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
was rather surprised to see the travelers again.</p>

<p>“Did you come back for more milk?” she
asked.</p>

<p>“No, thank you,” said Mr. Bobbsey, with
a laugh. “We came to return some of your
property that my small twins thoughtlessly
took.”</p>

<p>“My property!” exclaimed the lady. And
how she laughed when Mrs. Bobbsey handed
her the pasteboard box of kittens! “Oh, my
land sakes! You could have kept these, and
welcome!” she said. “We have all the cats
we want.”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid we could hardly look after
them,” explained Mrs. Bobbsey. “Thank
you, just the same. Dear me, when I felt
them wiggling at my feet, I couldn’t imagine
what they were!”</p>

<p>“I can well believe that,” said the farm
lady. “Well, I’ll give old Mary back her
family,” and she restored to the mother cat
the squirming, hungry kittens and Flossie and
Freddie viewed with delight how eager the
five were to snuggle down in the warm basket
with the one little pussy that had not been
taken away.</p>

<p>“Now you haven’t hidden any more animals<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
in the car, have you?” asked Mr. Bobbsey,
as he made ready to start again.</p>

<p>“No more,” declared the small twins, and
Mrs. Bobbsey looked to make sure no stray
puppy had crawled in among the things.</p>

<p>Perhaps, because Mr. Bobbsey was in a
hurry to make up the time and distance lost
by returning to the farmhouse, he missed a
side road altogether, or perhaps it was because
he took a wrong turn at some crossroad
in the journey, but certain it was that, late
in the afternoon when he came to a signboard
and read the names of the towns printed on
it, he said:</p>

<p>“We must have come the wrong way.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” asked his wife.</p>

<p>“We aren’t on the road to Hitchville,” was
the answer. “To get there we have to pass
through Midvale, and this sign doesn’t say
anything about that place. I must have
taken a wrong turn.”</p>

<p>“It is getting late, too,” remarked his wife.</p>

<p>“No harm is done, though,” said Mr. Bobbsey.
“I will ask the first person I meet
which is the best road to Midvale. Once
we are there, I can easily find the way to
Hitchville.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span></p>

<p>“Shall we get there to-night?” asked Nan.</p>

<p>“Why, of course we shall,” declared her
father.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, he concluded later that
he was not as sure of this as he wished he
could be. But there was only one thing to
do, and that was to go on until they met another
autoist or some one of whom they
could inquire.</p>

<p>For a mile or so the road was deserted.
But presently, on making a turn, the Bobbseys
saw coming toward them a farmer, driving
a bony horse drawing a rickety old wagon.</p>

<p>“Hello there!” called Mr. Bobbsey, halting
his car.</p>

<p>“Whoa—up!” the man directed his horse,
and the animal seemed glad enough to stop.
“Afternoon, stranger,” greeted the farmer.
“Are you looking for some one?”</p>

<p>“I’m looking for the road to Midvale, so
I can get to Hitchville,” explained Mr. Bobbsey.
“Or perhaps you know of a short cut
to Hitchville.”</p>

<p>The farmer shook his head.</p>

<p>“No, there isn’t any short cut,” he said.
“You’ll have to go to Midvale, as that’s the
only place where there’s a bridge over the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
river within ten miles. But you’re ’way off
the road to Midvale, even—’way off!”</p>

<p>“That’s what I was afraid of,” commented
Mr. Bobbsey. “What shall I do?”</p>

<p>The farmer considered matters for a moment
and then replied:</p>

<p>“Well, if I was you I’d keep right on this
road until you get to the next highway.
Turn to the right there and keep on for about
five miles and you’ll come to the road that
takes you to Midvale. After that you’ll be
all right.”</p>

<p>“Yes, after that I’ll be all right,” agreed
Mr. Bobbsey. “But how about this road
and the next—are they pretty good?”</p>

<p>“The roads are good enough,” replied the
farmer, as he looked at the Bobbsey twins.
“But they’re quite lonesome. However, you
can go faster in that machine than I can in
mine, and it won’t take you long. Good luck
to you! You’ve got quite a load of boys and
girls there,” he commented.</p>

<p>“Yes, quite a load, thank you,” answered
Mr. Bobbsey.</p>

<p>“We had five kittens, only we had to take
them back,” piped up Flossie.</p>

<p>“Did you? Well, I’ve got a batch of ’em<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
out at my place I’ll let you have,” chuckled
the farmer. “Just keep right along as I told
you an’ you’ll come out all right. G’lang!”
he called to his horse, and with a nod he drove
by, while Mr. Bobbsey, with a word of
thanks, let in the clutch and away they rode
once more.</p>

<p>“It’s too bad!” murmured Mrs. Bobbsey.</p>

<p>“Are we lost?” asked Freddie, half hoping
they were.</p>

<p>“Of course not!” laughed his father.
“We’ll soon be in Midvale, and it isn’t far
from there to Hitchville. We’ll be all right.
But I don’t call this a very good road,” he
went on, as he had to slow up over a rough
and rutty place.</p>

<p>The farmer’s idea of good roads did not
seem to be the same as Mr. Bobbsey’s, and
the farther they went the worse the way became,
until in one place it was necessary to
drop into second speed to get through a
stretch of deep sand.</p>

<p>It was now getting late in the afternoon,
and they had not yet come to the road which,
the farmer said, led to Midvale. Then, to
make matters worse, all at once there was a
sharp hiss of escaping air.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span></p>

<p>“Puncture!” cried Bert.</p>

<p>“So it is!” sighed his father. “Well, luckily
we have a spare on, and it won’t take long
to change.”</p>

<p>But it took longer than he thought, for the
road was sandy, and the jack, for lifting up
the car so the tire could be changed, sank
deeply into the soft earth. By the time some
boards and flat stones had been found to put
under the jack, it was getting dusk.</p>

<p>“You’ll hardly have the tire changed before
it’s dark,” said Mrs. Bobbsey with a look
around the lonely road.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid not,” agreed her husband.
“But we can drive after dark, you know.”</p>

<p>“I don’t like it much—on strange roads,”
she said. “I wish there were some place
where we could stay, but there doesn’t seem
to be.”</p>

<p>Nan, who had gotten out to walk around
with Flossie and Freddie while Bert helped
his father, now came back with the small
twins in time to hear what her mother said.</p>

<p>“There’s a house just around the turn
in the road where we might stay,” said
Nan.</p>

<p>“A house?” inquired her mother.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span></p>

<p>“Yes. A log cabin. Come, I’ll show it
to you!”</p>

<p>“Shall I go and look?” asked Mrs. Bobbsey
of her husband.</p>

<p>“Perhaps you had better,” he agreed.
“This tire is harder to change than I thought.
I’m afraid it’s going to take a long time.
But I can’t imagine there is any place around
here where we could put up for the night.
Still, it will do no harm to look. Hand me
that wrench again, Bert, please.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Bobbsey and three of the children
walked around the turn in the road.</p>

<p>“There it is,” said Nan.</p>

<p>She pointed to a lonely cabin set a little
way back from the highway. It seemed very
quiet—deserted, in fact—and as she looked
at it Mrs. Bobbsey felt a chill in her heart.</p>

<p>“I don’t like the looks of that!” she said.
“I’m afraid we could never stay there. No
one lives in it, and it’s such a lonely place!”</p>

<p>Flossie and Freddie drew closer to their
mother while the shadows of night settled
down about the lonely cabin.</p>

<p class="ph3">THE NIGHT CAMP</p>


<p>Mr. Bobbsey knew it was going to be hard
work to get the spare tire on the car and start
off again in the darkness to find Midvale.
He walked down the road a short distance
to where his wife and the children stood.
Bert went with him.</p>

<p>“The best thing for us to do,” said Mr.
Bobbsey, when he reached his wife’s side,
“will be to stay here all night. It’s too risky
going on now—the road is too bad, and I
can’t see very well to change the tire. We’ll
stay here!”</p>

<p>“Stay here?” repeated Mrs. Bobbsey.</p>

<p>“Bert and I can sleep in the auto,” went
on her husband. “We have often done it.”</p>

<p>“But there isn’t room for all of us!”</p>

<p>“You and Flossie and Freddie can sleep
in that cabin,” went on Mr. Bobbsey. “It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
will be a good shelter and it isn’t going to rain,
so it won’t matter if the roof leaks, and it
looks as if it might, the place is so old. We
have some auto robes with us, and the night
is going to be very warm.”</p>

<p>“Do you really mean I should stay in that
lonely cabin with Flossie and Freddie and
Nan?” asked Mrs. Bobbsey.</p>

<p>“Why not?” asked her husband. “We
have camped out in worse places than that,
and so have the children.”</p>

<p>“I like it!” declared Flossie. “Maybe
there’s a kitten in the cabin.”</p>

<p>“I like it, too,” said Freddie, always quick
to side with his twin sister. “We’ll pretend
we’re Indians!”</p>

<p>“Let’s take a look at the place and see if
it’s as bad as it appears,” suggested Mr.
Bobbsey. “Of course if it is too terrible,
we’ll try to get the spare tire on and move
along.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t want to give you too much
trouble,” Mrs. Bobbsey was quick to say.
“But at first glance that place looked sort of—well,
lonesome. Perhaps it will be all
right. Let’s go and look,” she concluded.</p>

<p>Once they were inside the cabin, it was not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
as bad as it appeared from the outside. True,
it was lonesome. The cabin, made of
logs, stood by itself in a weed-covered field
and there were no other houses within
sight.</p>

<p>There was nothing in the place save some
broken boxes and some bunks, like low, broad
shelves, built against the sides of the smaller
of two rooms. There were only two rooms
in the place, and no upstairs. In one of the
rooms there was a fireplace.</p>

<p>“Would you be afraid to sleep here?” Mr.
Bobbsey inquired of his wife. “We could
cut some branches from the evergreen trees
outside and spread them on the bunks.
They would be a sort of spring and mattress
together. Then with the auto robes you
would have a pretty good bed.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I guess it would be all right,” assented
his wife. “We’ll stay. It’s the only
thing we can do,” she added, with a look at
the gathering darkness outside. Indeed,
night had now come and only that Mr. Bobbsey
had brought a big electric flashlight in
with him from the car they could have seen
little in the lonely cabin.</p>

<p>“Well, then, come on, boys!” called their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
father to Bert and Freddie. “We’ll gather
evergreen boughs and make the beds.”</p>

<p>“I’ll help,” offered Nan.</p>

<p>“So will I!” chimed in Flossie.</p>

<p>“No, you stay with Mother, dear,” suggested
Mrs. Bobbsey. “You can help me
make a fire. I’ll just build a little blaze on the
hearth,” she told her husband. “It will give
us light to see and make it more cheerful.”</p>

<p>“There’s another flashlight in the car,” he
said.</p>

<p>“Better save that,” advised his wife. “A
little blaze of pieces of the old boxes will do
very nicely.”</p>

<p>When the blaze was crackling up the
chimney, built of field stones, the inside of
the lonely cabin was very cheerful. Mr.
Bobbsey and Nan and the boys brought in
armfuls of the sweet hemlock branches and
piled them on the wooden bunks which contained
not even a shred of a blanket.</p>

<p>“When are we going to eat?” asked Freddie,
when this work had been done.</p>

<p>“Yes, I’m hungry,” added Flossie.</p>

<p>“We shall have supper—such as it is—right
away,” answered Mrs. Bobbsey. “Luckily
Dinah put us up a big basket of food.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span></p>

<p>When a sort of bed had been arranged for
Bert and his father in the auto, where they
would have to lie curled up “like puppies,”
as Freddie said, and when the robes had been
brought in to spread under Mrs. Bobbsey
and the children, who would sleep in the
cabin bunks, then the basket of food was
opened.</p>

<p>Not much had been taken out for the noon
lunch, and plenty of sandwiches and other
good things remained for the evening meal.</p>

<p>They sat on broken boxes about the blaze
on the hearth and ate, becoming quite cheerful
and gay in spite of having to camp out so
unexpectedly.</p>

<p>“Do you think Mr. Watson will worry
because we don’t get there to-night?” asked
Nan of her mother, when the meal was over.</p>

<p>“No; for I didn’t say exactly when we
would get to Cloverbank,” answered Mr.
Bobbsey. “I told him when we would start
and said we hoped to reach Cloverbank the
same evening. But I did not say we would
certainly do so.”</p>

<p>“It’s a good thing you didn’t,” remarked
Mrs. Bobbsey. “We never expected to have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
to do this. But I rather like it,” she went
on, with a laugh.</p>

<p>“It’s lots of fun,” said Freddie.</p>

<p>Flossie said nothing, but from her manner
it was easy to see that the little girl was tired
and sleepy. Freddie, too, was “fighting the
sandman,” as his father called it, and so, after
making sure that his wife and the three twins
would be as comfortable as possible, Mr.
Bobbsey and Bert went out to the auto to
pass the night.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bobbsey had one bunk to herself, Nan
took Flossie in with her, and Freddie had
the third bunk, thus using all there were in
the cabin. At first the little boy wanted
to stay with his father and Bert in the car,
but his mother had said:</p>

<p>“But what shall we do without a man to
look after us in the cabin?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ll stay with you!” Freddie had
quickly replied. “You needn’t be afraid
of anything when I’m here. I’ll get a big
stick and keep it by my bunk, and if I hear a
noise in the night I’ll get up and hit it!”</p>

<p>“Do you mean you’ll hit the noise?” asked
Bert, with a laugh.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span></p>

<p>“I’ll hit the thing that makes the noise!”
declared Freddie.</p>

<p>So the Bobbsey twins had made a night
camp, and, once the first notion of loneliness
was gone, it was not bad at all, Mrs. Bobbsey
declared.</p>

<p>The small children were soon asleep, and
Nan was not long in following them to Dreamland.
Mrs. Bobbsey, however, could not so
easily drop off to slumber, and Mr. Bobbsey
did not find the auto as comfortable as he had
hoped.</p>

<p>Bert, however, was a healthy boy. He had
often camped out, and could curl up almost
anywhere and go to sleep. So he, too, was
soon slumbering peacefully.</p>

<p>Just what it was awakened Freddie the
little fellow afterward said he did not know.
But several hours after having gone to bed on
the hemlock boughs something caused him to
open his eyes with a start. At first he could
not remember where he was, it was so
different from awakening in his comfortable
bed at home. But when he saw a faint glow
of the fire on the cabin hearth, then he remembered.</p>

<p>“Oh, we’re camping out on the way to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
Cloverbank,” whispered Freddie to himself.
In the other bunks he could hear the gentle
breathing of his mother and sisters. Then
came again the noise that had startled the
little boy into wakefulness.</p>

<p>It was a noise as if some one were moving
something in the darkness—moving something
there in the cabin. It was not Freddie’s
mother nor Nan nor Flossie, for they were
lying in their bunks. The little boy could
see them by the faint glow of the embers.</p>

<p>Then came the rattle of wood, as if one
of the broken boxes was being dragged over
the floor.</p>

<p>“Oh, I guess it’s Daddy come in to put
more wood on the fire,” thought Freddie, with
a sigh of relief. “Is that you, Daddy?” he
asked in a loud whisper.</p>

<p>There was no answer, but the noise ceased.
And Freddie knew that if it had been his
father preparing to put more wood on the
fire, he would not have stopped because
Freddie spoke.</p>

<p>“No, it can’t be Daddy!” thought the
little fellow.</p>

<p>Then he heard the noise again, louder than
before. A piece of box was being dragged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
across the floor, and Freddie could hear the
scraping of feet—feet like those of an animal.</p>

<p>Freddie was a small boy, but he knew
enough to be sure it could be no large or
dangerous animal like a bear or a wolf. No
such animals were left in the woods so near
towns and villages. But it was <i>something</i>,
and what it was Freddie felt he must find out.</p>

<p>“I’ll throw my club on the fire,” he told
himself. “That will blaze up and I can see
what it is.”</p>

<p>True to his promise, the little boy had
placed a piece of dry wood—part of a box—near
his bunk when he went to bed. This
stick was to “hit a noise,” as Bert laughingly
said. Freddie now reached down, felt on
the floor until he found this wood, and then
he slipped off the bunk and started toward
the glowing fireplace.</p>

<p>But he had not taken more than three
steps when he stumbled over something and
fell down with a crash which awakened his
mother who cried:</p>

<p>“What is it? Who is there? What has
happened?”</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII</h2>
</div>

<p class="ph3">THE STORM</p>


<p>Silence followed the noise of Freddie’s
fall and his mother’s questions. But it was
silence for only a moment. The commotion
awakened Flossie, who caught hold of Nan,
with whom she was sleeping, and called out:</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know, dear,” Nan answered
quietly, for she did not want Flossie to be
frightened. Indeed, Nan, as yet, knew
nothing about which to be alarmed. True,
there had been a noise, but that often happened
at night, even at home.</p>

<p>Mr. Bobbsey, out in the car with Bert, also
heard the sounds in the cabin, his wife’s voice
having awakened him.</p>

<p>“I’m coming!” he cried, jumping out of
the car. None of the campers had taken off
their clothes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span></p>

<p>“So am I!” added Bert, as he followed his
father.</p>

<p>By this time Freddie had “picked himself
up,” as he said afterward, and discovered
that he had stumbled over a broken box in
the middle of the cabin floor. The little
fellow was not hurt.</p>

<p>Also by this time Mrs. Bobbsey had
reached for and turned on the flashlight her
husband had left with her, so that she could
see what had caused the commotion.</p>

<p>What she saw was Freddie standing with
his “club” in his hand, ready to cast it on
the embers, so there would be blaze enough to
see what had caused the noise. But the
gleam of the electric torch made Freddie’s
brand unnecessary now.</p>

<p>“What is it, Freddie?” asked his mother.
“Did you fall out of bed?”</p>

<p>“No, Mother, I didn’t fall out of bed,”
answered the little lad. “I got out to make
the fire brighter so I could see.”</p>

<p>“See what?” asked his father, who, by this
time, had come into the log cabin, followed by
Bert. “What did you want to see, little
fireman? Tell me!”</p>

<p>“Little fireman” was a good name for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
Freddie in this case, as he was about to start
the fire to blazing again.</p>

<p>“I wanted to see the noise,” stated Flossie’s
brother.</p>

<p>“Ho! Ho!” laughed Bert. “You can’t
<i>see</i> a noise.”</p>

<p>“Well, I wanted to see what made it,”
went on Freddie. “I heard a noise and it
woke me up.”</p>

<p>“Did the noise wake you, too, Mother?”
asked Nan.</p>

<p>“Well, some noise did, but I think it was
Freddie falling out of bed that I heard,”
answered Mrs. Bobbsey.</p>

<p>“I didn’t fall out of bed!” insisted Freddie.
“I got out all right, and then, in the dark, I
fell over one of these old boxes. It was a
noise like one of these broken boxes being
dragged over the floor that I heard. There
it goes again!” he cried, pointing to a dark
corner of the cabin. “Listen!”</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Bobbsey each held a flashlight
now, but the beams were turned away
from the corner toward which Freddie pointed
so that it was quite dark over there. Truly
enough, a noise had come from there.</p>

<p>Quickly Mr. Bobbsey pointed his light in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
that direction and an instant later there was
a scurrying of feet and a rattle of wood.</p>

<p>“Look! It’s a dog!” cried Freddie.</p>

<p>“Or maybe a skunk!” shouted Bert.
“Better be careful!”</p>

<p>“No, that wasn’t a skunk,” said his father.
“It was a dog, and he seemed to be dragging
that broken box, which would have made the
noise which Freddie heard.”</p>

<p>The dog had quickly run out, and when
Mr. Bobbsey went over to the corner, where
it seemed to have been hiding during the
excitement, the reason for it all was explained.</p>

<p>Caught in one corner of the broken box
was a bone with some meat on it. Perhaps
the dog himself had put the bone there during
the day and had come back in the night to get
it. But the bone had become wedged fast
and in pulling on it the dog moved the box
over the floor.</p>

<p>“And that’s what made the noise that
awakened Freddie,” said Mr. Bobbsey, when
he had finished looking in the corner. “The
dog came back here to get the midnight lunch
he had hidden, for it is midnight and past,”
Mr. Bobbsey went on, looking at his watch.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span></p>

<p>“Well, I’m glad it was only a dog,” said
Mrs. Bobbsey. “He may come back and
disturb us again, for the door is so broken
that it cannot be tightly shut,” she added.</p>

<p>“But I can toss the dog’s bone outside so
he will not need to come in after it,” said
Mr. Bobbsey. “That will keep him outside.
And since there is a dog around here I believe
we aren’t as far from a house where people
live as I thought at first. There may be a
settlement just over the hill. We’ll find out
in the morning. Now we can all go back to
sleep.”</p>

<p>This they did, and nothing more disturbed
them until the sun was shining in the morning,
when it was time to arise.</p>

<p>Mr. Bobbsey’s guess, about people living
just over the hill, was correct. He and Bert,
walking to the top of the hill and looking
about, saw several houses not more than half
a mile from the lonely cabin. At one of
these houses Mr. Bobbsey arranged for his
family to have breakfast.</p>

<p>“Have you got a dog?” asked Freddie of
the farmer, whose wife had agreed to set a
morning meal for the travelers.</p>

<p>“Yes, we have a dog,” was the answer.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
“At least, he stays here some of the time,
but mostly he roams around nights. There
he is now—been out all night, as usual,” and
with a laugh the man pointed to a small black
and white dog that came into the yard,
wagging its tail in a friendly fashion.</p>

<p>“That’s the dog that made a noise in the
night when I fell over the box!” declared
Freddie, and Bert said it was the same
animal that had come into the cabin after the
bone.</p>

<p>“It would be just like Major,” chuckled
the farmer. “So you stayed all night in the
old cabin, did you?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Mrs. Bobbsey, as she
sipped the hot, comforting coffee the farmer’s
wife set before her. “Did anybody ever live
there?”</p>

<p>“A queer, solitary sort of fellow—a farm
hand,” answered the farmer. “But that was
some time ago. It’s too bad you folks didn’t
come on just a bit farther and you could
have spent the night here.”</p>

<p>“We couldn’t get any farther with a flat
tire,” said Mr. Bobbsey. “Besides, from the
lonely look of that cabin, it didn’t seem as if
there was another house within ten miles.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, it is lonesome back there by the
cabin,” agreed the farmer. “But that fellow
liked it lonesome, he said. Do you want me
to hitch up and haul your car here?” he
asked.</p>

<p>“Oh, no, thank you,” replied Mr. Bobbsey.
“Now that it is daylight and I can see what
I’m doing, it will be easy enough to change
the tire. Then we can go on to Midvale and
thence to Hitchville. This road will take us
to Midvale, will it not?”</p>

<p>“It will if you keep on going long enough,”
the farmer said. “But you missed the best
and shortest way. However, there’s no help
for it now. I hope you don’t have any more
bad luck.”</p>

<p>“Thanks,” said Mr. Bobbsey.</p>

<p>The twins, as usual, finished their meal
before their father and mother were ready to
leave the table, and, being excused, they ran
out to see and make friends with Major, the
dog, who was ready enough to play with
them. There were other farm animals, also,
to be admired. A little lamb, its mother
dead, was being brought up on a baby’s
feeding bottle by one of the farm boys. The
little “cosset,” as a lamb of this kind is called,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
was so “dear and sweet” that the children
begged their father to buy it for them.</p>

<p>“I guess you’ll find something just as good
at Cloverbank,” he said, with a laugh.
“Anyhow, we haven’t any room for it in the
auto.”</p>

<p>“And I doubt if my Ned would sell it at
any price,” said the farmer. “He sets quite
a store by that cosset.”</p>

<p>So the Bobbsey twins had to leave without
it, and probably it was just as well, since the
auto was quite filled as it was.</p>

<p>The sunshine gave plenty of light for Mr.
Bobbsey to see to change the tire, and in a
little while the travelers were riding along
again after the night of adventure.</p>

<p>Midvale proved to be a pleasant little
village. Here a stop was made to get some
gasoline and oil, and then once more the
Bobbseys were on their way.</p>

<p>The road to Hitchville was a main one, well
traveled and with signs up in many places,
so there was no more danger of Mr. Bobbsey
taking the wrong turn. The children began
anticipating their arrival, and were talking
about what they would do when they reached<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
Cloverbank, which they hoped to do by early
afternoon.</p>

<p>But when Nan saw her mother and father
now and then turning to look up at the sky,
the Bobbsey girl thought something might
be amiss, so she asked about it.</p>

<p>“I think we are going to have a storm,”
her father replied. “I don’t like the looks
of those clouds.”</p>

<p>On and on they journeyed, going a bit
faster now that the storm seemed approaching
more rapidly. Fortunately the road was a
good one. As they went down a little hill
toward a white bridge, they saw a boy on it
jumping up and down, seemingly much
excited. He was shouting something and
pointing down toward the water.</p>

<p>“Somebody may have fallen in!” cried Mrs.
Bobbsey. “Stop the car, Dick, and find out!”</p>

<p>“I will!” was the answer, and the auto
came to a halt on the bridge, close to the
jumping, excited, shouting boy.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” called Mr. Bobbsey,
hurrying from his seat behind the wheel.
“Is somebody in the water?”</p>

<p>“Yes! Yes! There she is! She can’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
swim, either!” cried the boy. “Oh, get her
out!”</p>

<p>“Is it your sister?” asked Mrs. Bobbsey,
as she put aside some valises and bundles to
enable her to get out.</p>

<p>The boy did not answer, but kept shouting
and jumping around, meanwhile pointing to
the water. Mr. Bobbsey looked over the
railing of the bridge, but when he saw no
child in the stream, which at this point was
wide and deep, he turned to the boy and
said:</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with you? There’s
no one in there!”</p>

<p>“Yes, there is!” cried the lad. “It’s my
cat! She followed me down the road and
when an automobile ran close to her on the
bridge she tried to climb up on the rail and
she fell in! Oh, please get her out before she
drowns!”</p>

<p>Mr. Bobbsey looked again, and, sure
enough, saw a cat trying to swim to shore.
But cats aren’t like dogs. Their fur gets so
wet when they are in the water that it is hard
for them to get out again. Bert was going
to ask why the boy himself didn’t get his own
cat out, but when the Bobbsey lad saw how<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
small the other lad was, he held back the
question. Instead Bert cried:</p>

<p>“I’ll get her for you!” He ran down off
the road toward the edge of the river.</p>

<p>“Be careful!” warned his mother. “You
may fall in or get stuck in the mud!”</p>

<p>But Bert was taking no chances. He
picked up a piece of tree branch, and, leaning
over the edge of the stream, while he held to a
bush, he reached the branch out and pulled
the poor cat to shore. With pitiful mewings
and looking very wet and miserable, the pussy
crawled out.</p>

<p>“Oh, thanks!” cried the boy.</p>

<p>“You’re welcome,” answered Bert, with
a laugh.</p>

<p>The boy ran down and picked up the cat,
all dripping wet as it was, in his arms. Evidently
he loved animals, and if he had not
been so excited he, himself, might have rescued
his pet as Bert had done.</p>

<p>“I thought a child had fallen in,” said Mrs.
Bobbsey.</p>

<p>“So did I,” agreed her husband. “But if
we don’t hurry along we may all be as wet as
that kitten. It’s going to rain hard soon.
And with this wind it will be a driving<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
rain so the top on the car won’t be much
protection. It’s too much work to get up
the side curtains. We’d better run for
shelter.”</p>

<p>Leaving the boy with his wet cat calling
out renewed thanks to Bert, the Bobbsey
family started off once more. Now the sky
was torn with jagged flashes of lightning,
followed by low mutterings of thunder which
seemed to come nearer and nearer.</p>

<p>“I guess this is Hitchville,” said Mr.
Bobbsey, as they turned off a country road
into a town. Very soon several signs told them
that this guess was correct.</p>

<p>By this time the wind was blowing hard,
the lightning was more vivid, and the
thunder louder.</p>

<p>“Hadn’t we better run into some garage
here?” asked Mrs. Bobbsey of her husband,
as they passed along the main street of Hitchville.</p>

<p>“Wait until I find out how far it is to
Cloverbank farm,” he suggested. “We may
be able to get there before the storm breaks if
it isn’t too far.”</p>

<p>He stopped to make inquiries of a traffic
officer where the two main streets of Hitchville<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>
crossed, and the officer said Mr. Watson’s
place was about two miles out, on the
main road.</p>

<p>“We can make it!” decided Mr. Bobbsey.
“It won’t rain for ten minutes yet and we’ll
be there before then.”</p>

<p>But they had no sooner gotten beyond the
town than the first drops began splashing
down, to the accompaniment of loud thunder
and such glaring lightning as to make Flossie
hide her head in the auto robes.</p>

<p>“It’s going to pour in another minute!”
cried Mrs. Bobbsey. “I wish we had stayed
in Hitchville!”</p>

<p>“Yes, it would have been better,” agreed
her husband. They were on the main road
now, but there was no shelter in sight until,
as they made a turn, they saw just ahead of
them a farmhouse and a large barn up a lane
and near the road. The wide doors of the
barn were open, and as there came a sudden
burst of rain and a great crash of thunder,
Mrs. Bobbsey suggested:</p>

<p>“Drive into that barn, Dick. Then we’ll
be sheltered. Don’t try to go on to Cloverbank.”</p>

<p>“All right,” he replied, speaking loudly to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
be heard above the noise of the storm. “I
guess that’s the best thing to do!”</p>

<p>He swung the auto off the road, into the
lane, and up the inclined drive right into the
open barn, much to the surprise of two men
who were inside, having evidently gone there
for shelter.</p>

<p>A moment later it seemed as if the sky
were torn open to let down the rain which
dashed around the barn in a fury, whipped
by the high wind, while the lightning flashed
and the thunder rumbled.</p>

<p class="ph3">AT CLOVERBANK</p>


<p>“Thank goodness, we’re in a dry place!”
exclaimed Mrs. Bobbsey with a sigh of relief,
as the car came to a stop within the shelter
of the big barn.</p>

<p>“It doesn’t rain in here, does it?” asked
Freddie.</p>

<p>“Of course it doesn’t,” declared Nan, with
a laugh.</p>

<p>“It rains on the roof of the barn. I can
hear it!” said Flossie.</p>

<p>The children, who had been a bit cramped
by the long auto ride and somewhat wet by
the dashing rain, now prepared to get out of
the car. They wanted to watch the storm
from the safe shelter of the farm building.</p>

<p>The two men, who had, it seemed, also
taken shelter there from the downpour, had
been looking curiously at the Bobbsey<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
family. Seeing this, Mr. Bobbsey smiled and
said:</p>

<p>“I hope the owner of this barn won’t mind
my driving in like this.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, the owner won’t mind a bit,”
answered one of the men, with a laugh.
“You’re perfectly welcome.”</p>

<p>“Do you happen to know the owner?”
asked Mrs. Bobbsey.</p>

<p>“Well, yes, I might say I do,” went on the
man who had first spoken. “I know him
quite well.”</p>

<p>“I should say you did!” chuckled the other
man.</p>

<p>“We are on our way to a place called
Cloverbank,” said Mr. Bobbsey. “We are
going to stay there for the summer. I think
it is near here.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, it’s right near here,” went on the
man who had said he knew the owner of the
barn. “In fact, it couldn’t be any closer;
could it, Zeek?” and he nodded to his companion.</p>

<p>“It’s about as close as you can get to it,”
declared the other.</p>

<p>Just then Mrs. Bobbsey gave a little cry of
delight and exclaimed:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, now I know you! I was wondering
where I had seen you before! You are Mr.
Watson himself!” and she walked forward
and held out her hand to the man who had
first spoken.</p>

<p>“Is this Baby May—I mean Baby Jenny’s
father?” asked Nan.</p>

<p>“That’s who I am!” was the laughing reply.</p>

<p>“And is this Cloverbank?” demanded
Freddie.</p>

<p>“That’s what it is, little man!” said Mr.
Watson. “You drove right in on us. This
is one of my barns, and I’m glad Zeek and I
had the doors open so you could roll right in.
Welcome to Cloverbank! I wish you could
have arrived in better weather,” he continued,
as a vivid flash of lightning came and
a heavy peal of thunder seemed to shake
the ground. “But I think the storm will
soon be over.”</p>

<p>“I hope so!” exclaimed Mrs. Bobbsey.
“But just fancy us, turning right in here!
It’s remarkable!”</p>

<p>“Zeek and I had to run for it ourselves,”
explained Mr. Watson. “I had left the
doors open to dry out some early hay I had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
hauled in, and Zeek—his name is Zeek Trimmer
and he works for me,” he explained,
as the hired man nodded, “Zeek and I were
working around outside, when, almost before
we knew it, the rain came down in bucketfuls.
So we had to run to the barn.”</p>

<p>“And then you folks came along,” added
Zeek, who seemed a very pleasant sort of
person. The Bobbsey twins thought they
were going to like him very much.</p>

<p>“I’m very glad to see you again, Mr.
Watson,” said Mr. Bobbsey as he shook
hands with the farmer. “I didn’t know you
at first. I guess I must have had some rain
in my eyes. How is Mrs. Watson and Baby
May—I mean Baby Jenny? We all have a
habit of calling the little girl by the name we
gave her,” he explained.</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” laughed the farmer.
“She’s fine, and so is my wife. They’ll be
mighty pleased to see you. We’ll go to the
house as soon as this rain lets up. You can
leave your car right here for a while. Afterward
we can run it to the garage. But
you’re a little late, aren’t you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, we were delayed on the road,”
explained Mr. Bobbsey, and he told of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
happenings on the trip, how they had had to
go back to return the five kittens, and then
how they had had to stay all night at the
lonely cabin.</p>

<p>“Well, we’re glad to see you, anyhow,”
returned the farmer. “Zeek and I will
bring your things in,” he went on, as he saw
Mrs. Bobbsey beginning to take articles out
of the car.</p>

<p>“I guess I better carry my doll,” explained
Flossie. “You might drop her, Mr. May—I
mean Mr. Watson,” she quickly corrected
herself.</p>

<p>“All right, little lady!” chuckled Baby
Jenny’s father. “I’m used to carrying my
own little girl, and I don’t drop her; but
maybe your doll is so heavy she might slip
out of my arms. Though I could wrap her
in a bundle of hay and carry her like that,”
he added, as he caught up a wisp of hay from
the barn floor and pretended it was a doll.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, you could carry her that way,”
admitted Flossie. “But I guess I’d better
take her myself—though thank you just the
same,” she added after a moment of thought.
Then she took her doll, which her mother
handed out of the car.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span></p>

<p>“And I’ll take my fire engine,” said
Freddie. “That might get smashed.” He
hauled his toy out from amid the valises and
packages, and as he set it on the floor he
went on: “It squirts real water, Mr. Watson,
and if your barn gets on fire I can help put it
out for you.”</p>

<p>“That’s right kind of you,” said the
farmer, trying not to laugh, for Freddie was
very much in earnest. “I hope my barn
won’t get on fire, though.”</p>

<p>Just then came a tremendous crash of
thunder, following closely after a bright glare
of lightning.</p>

<p>Mr. Watson went over near Zeek Trimmer,
who stood just inside the door, to look out
and see if the lightning had done any damage
to his farm buildings or the house, which the
children could see through the rain, a short
distance away.</p>

<p>“I guess that was the last crack, and the
worst,” said the farmer. “It will stop in a
little while, and then we can go to the house.
Mrs. Watson has been expecting you, but
she never thought you would come in a
downpour like this.”</p>

<p>While the older folks stood in the middle of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
the barn floor, talking, the children wandered
about the big barn. They always liked to
come to the country, especially to a farm, for
there were so many strange bits of machinery
to see and so many things to do about a
barn.</p>

<p>“Mr. Watson! Mr. Watson!” called Freddie,
who had put his toy fire engine down in
what he thought a safe place.</p>

<p>“Yes, little man, what is it?” asked the
farmer.</p>

<p>“Could we please slide down on your
hay—I mean Flossie and I?” Freddie asked.
“We like to slide on hay, and we haven’t
done it for a long time.”</p>

<p>“Slide all you like,” Mr. Watson kindly
gave permission. “That is, if your mother
says so,” he added, with a look at Mrs. Bobbsey.</p>

<p>“I guess they won’t get hurt,” she remarked.</p>

<p>“Well, they can’t harm the hay!” chuckled
Zeek.</p>

<p>So the two smaller twins, with shouts of
delight, climbed up in the haymow where
there were great piles of the dried, sweet-smelling
grass which the horses, cows, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
sheep would eat when winter came, and when
there was no longer green fodder in the fields.</p>

<p>Bert and Nan thought themselves a little
too old for this kind of fun—at least, when
there were older folks around. Though
undoubtedly if just the four twins had been in
the barn, the two larger ones would have
enjoyed doing what Flossie and Freddie were
doing.</p>

<p>These two scrambled up to the highest
point of one of the hay piles and then slid
down, the hay being almost as slippery as a
hill covered with snow.</p>

<p>Bert and Nan wandered about the barn,
looking at the different things. Bert wished
there were some horses he might view, but the
farm animals were kept in another building,
this large one being used for the storage of
hay and other crops.</p>

<p>Presently Nan, who was peering about
along the edge of the hay mow, gave an exclamation
of surprise.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” asked Bert.</p>

<p>“Look!” whispered Nan, pointing down
through a small opening in the floor. “There’s
a hen on her nest. Maybe she’s laying an
egg!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span></p>

<p>“Maybe,” agreed Bert. “If she is we
mustn’t disturb her.”</p>

<p>But the hen was already disturbed, for she
looked up and saw the children and then,
with a loud cackle, she fluttered off the nest
and ran across the barn floor.</p>

<p>“Oh, I didn’t mean to scare her!” murmured
Nan.</p>

<p>“You didn’t do any harm,” said Mr.
Watson, with a laugh. “That’s Old Speck,
as we call her. She always steals away to
make a nest for herself, lays a lot of eggs in it
and then hatches out a brood of chickens. I’ve
been trying for a week to find her nest.
Show me where it is. Are there any eggs in
it?”</p>

<p>“Oh, a lot of them!” cried Nan.</p>

<p>“About a dozen,” reported Bert.</p>

<p>“Then she’s getting ready to hatch out a
family of little chickens,” Mr. Watson said.
“I’ll be on the watch for them, now that I
know where she has hidden her nest. It’s
queer you found it so soon, Nan, when I’ve
been looking for it a week and couldn’t find
it.”</p>

<p>“I guess maybe the wind blew away some
hay that was over the top, and that’s why I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
saw her,” explained the little girl, and this
seemed to be about the way of it.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll put a board over the hole from
the top, so she won’t be disturbed again,”
Mr. Watson said. “Get a board, Zeek. Old
Speck must crawl in under the barn to get on
her nest, so the board won’t shut her out.”</p>

<p>The rain was lessening now, and the lightning
was not so sharp nor the thunder so
loud. All signs pointed to a clearing off of
the storm. Meanwhile, Flossie and Freddie
were having fun in the hay until, all of a sudden,
Flossie gave a scream of excitement and
cried:</p>

<p>“There! Now look, Freddie Bobbsey,
what you did! You’ve killed her!”</p>

<p>“Gracious!” cried Mrs. Bobbsey. “I hope
Freddie didn’t slide down on the hen,” for
Nan had told about finding Old Speck.</p>

<p>“He slid right on my doll, that’s what he
did!” cried Flossie. “He slid on her, and he
sat on her, and he’s killed her! Oh, dear!”</p>

<p>She was about ready to burst into tears, but
Nan, running to Freddie, who sat on the barn
floor in some hay which had slid with him off
the big pile, picked up Flossie’s doll and
called out:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span></p>

<p>“She isn’t hurt a bit! See! She’s all
right, Flossie!”</p>

<p>“Will her eyes open and shut?” asked the
little girl.</p>

<p>“Surely they open and shut,” reported
Nan, tilting the doll backward and then forward,
which caused the blue eyes to close
and then to open.</p>

<p>“Well, then, I guess she’s all right,”
Flossie agreed, choking back her tears.
“But you oughtn’t to have sat on her,
Freddie Bobbsey!”</p>

<p>“How could I help it?” Freddie asked. “I
didn’t mean to do it! I just slid with a lot
of hay. I didn’t know you had put your doll
down there.”</p>

<p>“Well, I had,” Flossie said. “But I’m
glad you didn’t mean to hurt her. I guess
we’ve had enough of hay-sliding, anyhow.”</p>

<p>“I guess so, too,” agreed Freddie. “Anyhow,
the sun is shining now and we can go to
the house. I want to see the clover bank.”</p>

<p>“And I want to see the baby,” added Flossie.</p>

<p>The storm, indeed, had ended and the
weather was clearing. With Mr. Watson,
Zeek, and Mr. Bobbsey carrying the baggage,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
and the children taking their toys and playthings,
the party moved on toward the big
farmhouse. On the porch stood Mrs. Watson.</p>

<p>“Well, of all things!” she cried, as she
caught sight of the Bobbsey family. “How
did you folks get here?”</p>

<p>“We came in the storm and drove right
into your barn, not knowing whose it was,”
explained Mrs. Bobbsey.</p>

<p>“How glad I am to see you!” went on Mrs.
Watson, as the children and the others trooped
up the front steps. “We have been expecting
you—in fact, we looked for you yesterday.”</p>

<p>“And we would have been here then, only
for the many things that happened,” explained
Mr. Bobbsey. “It is very kind of
you and your husband to ask this whole
family out here for the summer.”</p>

<p>“We’re glad to have you,” said Mrs.
Watson.</p>

<p>“Where’s the baby?” asked Nan.</p>

<p>“You mean Jenny?” asked the mother.
“Oh, she’s in the house. She’s grown so you
will hardly know her,” she went on proudly.</p>

<p>“Can she talk?” Freddie wanted to know.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span></p>

<p>“A little, yes, my dear,” was the answer.</p>

<p>“Can she walk?” was Flossie’s question.</p>

<p>“She’s just beginning to, yes. And that
reminds me. She may get up and walk into
some mischief now. I hardly dare leave her
alone, she is so active, Mrs. Bobbsey. You’d
hardly believe the——”</p>

<p>But Mrs. Watson did not finish what she
was saying. She was interrupted by a loud
noise from within the house. Instantly she
turned and ran inside, crying:</p>

<p>“Oh, Baby! Baby! What have you done
now?”</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X</h2>
</div>

<p class="ph3">FREDDIE’S CRASH</p>


<p>Somewhat alarmed by the crash, Mrs.
Bobbsey and the others followed Mrs. Watson
into the house. Mr. Watson, who, with
Zeek and Mr. Bobbsey, had just arrived from
the barn with some of the baggage, rushed in,
exclaiming:</p>

<p>“My land, sounds like that youngster has
had another fall!”</p>

<p>“Does she fall much?” asked Mr. Bobbsey.</p>

<p>“About three times a day, on the average,”
explained the father. “But she’s very lucky—she
hardly ever gets hurt. You see, she
has just found out she can walk, and she takes
too many chances.”</p>

<p>“I hope nothing has happened,” said Mr.
Bobbsey.</p>

<p>A moment later they heard Mrs. Watson’s
laugh from within the house and all felt sure
that matters were all right.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, my dear, what a fright you gave me!”
Mrs. Watson could be heard saying.</p>

<p>“What happened?” asked her husband,
as his wife appeared carrying the little
one.</p>

<p>“Oh, she just pulled over a chair and upset
the basket of empty spools we keep for her
to play with,” explained Mrs. Watson.
“You ought to see how cute she looked,
wondering what it was all about.”</p>

<p>“Mustn’t pull over chairs!” playfully
warned Mr. Watson, as he held out his
finger, which the little one grasped with a
smile of delight. “You might break the
furniture!”</p>

<p>“Break the furniture! As if that mattered!”
cried his wife. “She might have
hurt herself!”</p>

<p>“My, how she has grown!” exclaimed Mrs.
Bobbsey, taking the baby from its mother.</p>

<p>“She’s getting to be a big girl,” added
Mr. Bobbsey. “She doesn’t look like the
little stranger we found on our doorstep.”</p>

<p>“Cloverbank is a good place for children
to grow up in,” remarked Mr. Watson.
“Yours will be so big when they go back to
Lakeport the neighbors won’t know them.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span></p>

<p>“Well, I only hope they don’t grow out of
their clothes,” said their mother, with a
laugh. “I didn’t bring many suits with me.”</p>

<p>By this time the Bobbsey twins were
gathered about Baby Jenny, or, as the smaller
children often called her “Baby May.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t she cute!” murmured Nan.</p>

<p>“May I hold her?” begged Flossie.</p>

<p>“Yes, a little while, if you will sit down
in a chair so you won’t drop her,” Mrs.
Watson promised. Baby Jenny seemed glad
to see the visitors and smiled and “jabbered”
at them, as Bert said afterward, though the
baby’s mother said:</p>

<p>“Just listen to her talk, would you? Isn’t
she bright?”</p>

<p>“Indeed, yes!” agreed Mrs. Bobbsey.</p>

<p>“Could you understand what the baby
said?” Bert asked Nan a little later.</p>

<p>“Not a word,” was the answer. “But I
guess all babies talk like that. Only their
mothers can understand them.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile Flossie, much to her delight,
was allowed to hold the little one in her
lap.</p>

<p>“It’ll be your turn pretty soon, Freddie,”
said Flossie to her brother, for as the two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>
smaller twins always shared everything they
had or did, naturally Flossie thought her
small brother would want a part in holding
Baby Jenny.</p>

<p>“I guess I rather let her play with my fire
engine,” Freddie said, squirming around on
one foot. “I don’t zazackly know how to
hold babies.”</p>

<p>“Well, I wouldn’t want you to drop mine!”
laughed the mother. “But make yourselves
at home, folks,” she went on. “My, you
must be tired with your long trip and sleeping
in a cabin and then getting here in the rain.
But it’s clearing off beautifully now,” she
added.</p>

<p>So through the rooms of the big, pleasant
farmhouse they went, and soon they were
all made to feel at home by the kindness of
Mr. and Mrs. Watson, not to mention the
smiles and cooings of the baby.</p>

<p>The weather had cleared, following the
heavy thunderstorm, and gave promise of
many fair days to come.</p>

<p>“Won’t we have fun here?” said Bert to
Nan, as the two put on their play suits ready
to go out and explore the place.</p>

<p>“It’s just lovely!” Nan said. “I’m so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
glad we came! I’ve got a lot of things to
write about for my composition already.”</p>

<p>“What composition?” Bert inquired.</p>

<p>“The one we are going to write to try to win
the prize Miss Skell offered,” explained Nan.
“Aren’t you going to write a composition
about what happens this summer, Bert?”</p>

<p>“Oh, maybe,” he replied, not much interested,
it appeared. “But I have to see
something happen first.”</p>

<p>“Why, a lot has happened already!” exclaimed
Nan. “There were the five kittens,
and sleeping in the lonely cabin, and then
the thunderstorm, and us not knowing it
was the Cloverbank barn we drove into, and
Mrs. Watson thinking the baby was hurt—all
those things have happened and we
haven’t really begun yet.”</p>

<p>“Oh, if you call <i>those</i> happenings—yes,”
agreed Bert. “But they aren’t any good
to put in a composition to win a prize.”</p>

<p>“Of course they are!” insisted Nan. “The
teacher said it was better to write about the
common, everyday happenings, if we did it
well, than to try to write about something
big we didn’t know anything about.”</p>

<p>“Um! Maybe,” admitted Bert. “But<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>
there’s plenty of time. We have all summer
ahead of us. I’ll write my composition the
last week when I see what has happened.”</p>

<p>“I’m going to write down the different
things that happen every day, and then I’ll
pick out the most interesting and write
about them,” decided Nan. “I do hope
I win that prize!”</p>

<p>“I hope you do, too,” said Bert kindly. “I
guess I won’t try for it, and then it will be
easier for you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, you must try, too,” declared Nan,
and Bert said he would think it over.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the other Bobbsey twins, who
had also put on their everyday clothes, had
come down to wander about the place to discover
what there was with which they could
play and have a good time.</p>

<p>“But I want to see the clover bank,” insisted
Freddie. “Where is it?”</p>

<p>“There it is, little man,” said Zeek Trimmer,
who was passing on his way back to the
barn. The hired man pointed to a side hill
not far away. It was green with growing
clover which was washed clean by the recent
rain.</p>

<p>“I don’t see any bank,” Freddie stated.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
“There’s a bank at home in Lakeport where
Daddy puts his money. But I don’t see any
place where they put clover.”</p>

<p>“Ho! Ho!” laughed Bert. “I guess he
thought the clover bank was a building like
the money bank at home.”</p>

<p>“Well, isn’t it?” Freddie inquired.</p>

<p>“No, dear,” explained Nan. “That’s just
a bank, or hill, of dirt, and the clover leaves
and blossoms grow on it. I suppose it’s
such a big bank, or side-hill field, of clover,
that Mr. Watson named his farm Cloverbank.
Isn’t that it?” she asked the hired
man.</p>

<p>“That’s it,” was Zeek’s reply. “We’ve
got the best field of side-hill clover on any
farm for miles around. And we’ve got the
best peach orchards, too,” he added proudly.</p>

<p>“Oh, do you grow peaches?” cried Bert.</p>

<p>“I should say we do. They’re almost
ripe, too, and we’ll begin picking in a few
days.”</p>

<p>“Does Mrs. Watson can the peaches?”
Nan asked, for she had sometimes helped her
mother at preserving time by washing the
glass cans.</p>

<p>“There’s more peaches at Cloverbank than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>
Mrs. Watson could ever can,” said Zeek.
“Come and I’ll show you.”</p>

<p>With shouts of delight the Bobbsey twins
followed the hired man, Flossie and Freddie
already feeling so friendly with him that they
had hold of his hands.</p>

<p>“Where are you going?” called Mrs.
Bobbsey from the porch.</p>

<p>“I’m just taking them to one of the peach
orchards,” answered Zeek.</p>

<p>“Is there more than one orchard?” asked
Bert, in surprise.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” the hired man replied. “Mr.
Watson has several large ones. Part of his
business is raising peaches for the market.
We’ll begin picking and shipping soon.”</p>

<p>Zeek took the children to one of the orchards
where there were many rows of small
trees, each one laden with peaches, many of
which were beginning to show the yellow,
pink, and red cheeks which told they were
nearly ripe.</p>

<p>“And over the clover hill are more orchards,
just like this,” the hired man said.
“Now let’s see if we can find a few ripe
ones.”</p>

<p>He picked a few, but would not let the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>
children eat any until they were back at the
house, when Mrs. Bobbsey gave permission
for each of the twins to have one.</p>

<p>“If you eat any more you won’t be hungry
when meal time comes,” said Mrs. Watson.</p>

<p>“I guess I’d be hungry if I ate five peaches,”
declared Bert. “I have a big appetite to-day.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad of it,” said Mrs. Watson, with a
laugh. “Then you’ll appreciate the roast
chicken.”</p>

<p>“Oh—chicken—goodie!” cried Flossie and
Freddie.</p>

<p>At the table a little later, not only Bert,
but the other three Bobbsey twins proved
that they had good appetites. It was a
delightful meal.</p>

<p>The afternoon was spent in going about
the farm, viewing the different buildings,
fields, and peach orchards, and when night
came four tired but happy children were
ready for bed, where Baby Jenny had long
since gone.</p>

<p>The next few days were happy ones. There
seemed something new to do from the time
the children were up in the morning until the
sun went down at night. The twins were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>
out of doors all day long, for after the big
thunderstorm the weather was delightful.</p>

<p>“When are you going to pick peaches?”
asked Bert of Mr. Watson at the dinner
table one day.</p>

<p>“I think we’ll begin to-morrow, if it doesn’t
rain,” was the answer. “I have advertised
for help, and if the day is fair the pickers
will be here by sunrise, I expect.”</p>

<p>This is what happened, and when the
children awoke, some time after sunrise, however,
they looked upon a busy scene. A
number of men and women and some large
boys and girls had arrived to help gather the
peach crop.</p>

<p>“Oh, let’s go down and see them!” cried
Nan.</p>

<p>As their mother and father were as interested
as the twins, soon the whole Bobbsey
family were in one of the orchards.</p>

<p>In among the rows of trees were tall stepladders,
and standing on these the pickers
plucked the ripe fruit, putting the peaches
into cloth bags that hung about their shoulders.
When the bags were filled, the pickers
climbed down and emptied the fruit into big
boxes that stood about.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span></p>

<p>While some were doing this, other workers
sorted out the best peaches into baskets which
were put on a motor car and hauled to the
big barn into which Mr. Bobbsey had driven
the day of the storm.</p>

<p>“In the barn,” Mr. Bobbsey explained to
the children, “the peaches are sorted again,
wooden tops are fastened on the baskets, and
they are then hauled to the big peach market
in a distant city where they are sold.”</p>

<p>“Oh, could we go to the peach market?”
asked Bert.</p>

<p>“Perhaps,” his father said.</p>

<p>“Why don’t they just shake the trees and
let the peaches fall on the ground and then
pick them up?” asked Freddie.</p>

<p>“That would never do,” said his father.
“The peaches would become bruised by falling
on the ground, and once a peach, apple,
or other fruit is bruised it rots very quickly.
Great care must be had in picking the best
fruit if it is to be sold for a good price in the
market. See how careful the pickers are.”</p>

<p>But in spite of all the care used, there were
soft and bruised peaches. Some fell off the
tree before they could be picked. These
soft peaches were put in a separate bin.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>
They could be sold to a near-by canning factory
to be made into marmalade, the soft
parts being cut out.</p>

<p>It was a busy and entertaining sight in the
peach orchard, and as Nan looked on she
said to Bert:</p>

<p>“I’m going to put this about peach-picking
in my composition.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m going to put a peach into myself,”
said Bert, with a laugh.</p>

<p>“I wish we could help pick,” said Nan,
after a while, and Mr. Watson, passing
through the orchard, heard this and said:</p>

<p>“Of course you can help. Here, Zeek, put
them at one of the low trees where they can
reach without a ladder.”</p>

<p>And, to their delight, the Bobbsey twins,
even Freddie and Flossie, were soon helping
gather the peach crop. They picked the
fruit carefully, put it in bags which were
given them, and carried the full bags to the
big boxes.</p>

<p>Then something happened. Freddie, not
content to stand up on a box and reach the
fruit just over his head, saw, not far away,
a tall stepladder. Saying nothing to his
brother or sisters about it, the little fellow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
slipped away by himself, and when Nan
looked for him she saw him up on top of the
ladder reaching up into the higher limbs of a
peach-laden tree.</p>

<p>“Freddie! Freddie! Come down off
that!” ordered Nan.</p>

<p>And then Freddie came down, but not in
just the way Nan intended. For he reached
too far to pick a red peach, overbalanced
himself, and, a moment later, over went the
ladder with a crash, little boy and all.</p>

<p>“Oh! Oh!” he cried.</p>

<p>“Oh! Oh!” gasped Nan.</p>

<p>“Look out!” shouted Bert.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI</h2>
</div>

<p class="ph3">BERT HAS AN UPSET</p>


<p>With a thud Freddie crashed down. But
instead of hitting the hard ground, he fell
into a box of soft peaches, and it was like
falling on a load of hay—almost. In fact,
some of the peaches were so soft that Freddie
was smeared with the pulp and his face and
clothes were stained with the juice.</p>

<p>“Oh, Freddie Bobbsey!” cried his mother,
who had come up in time to see her little boy
fall.</p>

<p>“I—now—I couldn’t help it, Mother!
Really I couldn’t!” protested Freddie, as he
tried to climb out of the box of soft peaches.</p>

<p>“I know you couldn’t help it, my dear,”
his mother said, as she and Bert helped him
to climb over the edge of the box. “But you
should never lean too far to one side when you
are up on a ladder. Oh, Freddie, you are a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
sad sight!” she sighed as she looked at his
soiled garments. “And Mr. Watson’s
peaches! Oh, dear!”</p>

<p>“Freddie looks like a peach short-cake,” remarked
Nan.</p>

<p>“More like a long-cake,” declared Bert.
“He’s got peach pulp all over him.”</p>

<p>“Well, they’re my old clothes, anyhow,”
said Freddie, as if that helped some, which it
probably did.</p>

<p>“Did you get any peach in your mouth?”
asked Flossie.</p>

<p>Freddie moved his tongue around over his
teeth to make sure.</p>

<p>“No, I guess I didn’t,” he answered.
“But I’ll go up to the house and wash,
Mother, and put on other clothes, and then I
can help pick more peaches, can’t I?”</p>

<p>“I guess you’d better stay on the ground
or on a box which isn’t so high as the ladder,
and then you won’t fall next time,” suggested
Mr. Watson, with a laugh.</p>

<p>“Did he do any damage?” asked Mr.
Bobbsey, who came up from another part of
the orchard in time to see Nan leading her
small brother back to the house to help him
change his clothes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span></p>

<p>“No damage at all. He fell in the soft
peaches that are going to the factory where
they will be made into peach butter,”
answered the farmer. “For canned peaches,
either in halves or slices, the canning factory,
of course, uses only good, sound fruit. But
the soft ones, when they aren’t actually
rotten, can be made up into peach butter,
and very good it is, too. No, Freddie didn’t
do any harm.”</p>

<p>The work of gathering the peaches was in
full swing now, for it was the time to gather
the best of the crop and sell while the prices
were high.</p>

<p>“Where do you sell your fruit?” asked Mr.
Bobbsey of the farmer when Freddie had returned
to the orchard.</p>

<p>“Over in Hitchville,” was the answer.
“There’s a peach market there, where the
wholesale buyers come and buy them by the
truck load. I’ll have about two loads ready
to go in to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Could we go with you and see how they
sell peaches?” asked Bert, who hoped, when
he grew up, to become a business man like his
father.</p>

<p>“Yes, you children can ride on the truck<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>
if you like,” the farmer said. “But you’d
be more comfortable going in your own car.
The trucks are big and heavy and aren’t easy
riding.”</p>

<p>“I’ll take the whole family over in my car,”
Mr. Bobbsey said.</p>

<p>“And it will give me a chance to do a little
shopping at the Hitchville stores,” Mrs.
Bobbsey said. “I need some things for the
children.”</p>

<p>So the trip was planned for the following
day, by which time many peaches would be
picked by the orchard workers. After a while
the Bobbsey twins became tired of “helping,”
as they called it, and they had eaten all the
peaches that were good for them, so they
turned to look for something new to amuse
them.</p>

<p>“Why don’t you go up in the barn and
watch them sorting the peaches?” suggested
their mother. “That will be fun.”</p>

<p>“Oh, let’s!” exclaimed Flossie. “And we
can roll on the hay.”</p>

<p>But just then Bert saw a small cart drawn
by an old and slow-going horse being driven
into the orchard by Zeek. Bert at once had
an idea.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span></p>

<p>“What’s that cart for, Mr. Watson?” the
boy asked.</p>

<p>“We use that to cart the soft peaches in,
as it doesn’t do much harm if they get shaken
up and bruised a bit more,” the farmer
answered. “We have to be more careful
with the sound fruit, and I send that up to the
barn on my small auto truck. But we don’t
much care what happens to the soft peaches.”</p>

<p>“Do you think—now—maybe—if I was
careful—I could drive the cart back to the
barn?” asked Bert eagerly. “I’d love to
drive the horse, and I know how, for I did it
once when we were at Meadow Brook. Could
I, please, Mr. Watson?”</p>

<p>“There won’t be any danger driving this
horse,” chuckled Zeek, as he brought the
animal to a stop near the box of soft peaches
into which Freddie had toppled. “He’ll
stand without hitching any minute of the
day or night.”</p>

<p>“Do you think it would be all right for
Bert to take in a load?” asked Mr. Watson
of his hired man.</p>

<p>“Oh, sure!” was the answer.</p>

<p>“I’ll be very careful!” promised the small
boy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span></p>

<p>“Well, wait until I load the truck and you
can take charge,” suggested Zeek, one of
whose duties was to transport the soft peaches
to the barn and later to the canning factory
after they had been sorted.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Nan had taken Freddie and
Flossie to the big barn where a number of
men were engaged in the work of carefully
sorting the best peaches into several grades.</p>

<p>“Well, all right,” said Mr. Watson, as he
moved on to visit another of his orchards.
“I’ll leave this to you and Zeek, my boy.”</p>

<p>Delighted at doing what seemed to be real
work, as it was, in a way, Bert helped Zeek
put into baskets the best of the soft peaches
from the box of discarded ones. Some were
so soft that it would not be wise to take them
to the barn. These very soft ones and some
that had been crushed or broken by falls
were put in another box and later fed to the
pigs and chickens.</p>

<p>When the small cart was loaded Zeek told
Bert how to drive to reach the barn and also
told the boy what to do when he got there.</p>

<p>“Aren’t you going to ride with me?” asked
Bert, for he thought the hired man would at
least be with him on the cart.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span></p>

<p>“No, I’m not going,” was the reply.
“Land sakes, I guess you can manage a load
of soft peaches all right, ’specially when
Tramper is hitched to the cart.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I guess I can,” Bert assented.
“Is the horse named Tramper?” he inquired.</p>

<p>“That’s his name,” replied Zeek, with a
laugh. “I named him that myself,” he
added.</p>

<p>“Won’t Nan and the others be surprised
when they see me driving up all alone?”
exclaimed Bert, with a happy laugh as he
climbed up to the seat of the cart and looked
at the pile of soft peaches behind him.</p>

<p>“Well, don’t give ’em too much of a surprise,”
advised Zeek.</p>

<p>“Do you mean Tramper might run away?”
the boy asked.</p>

<p>“Oh, no danger of that!” chuckled the
hired man. “But don’t upset the cart before
you get to the barn. After you get there it
doesn’t matter much what happens.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I won’t upset!” promised Bert.
“I know how to drive.”</p>

<p>For a time all went well. There was a
level road leading into and out of the orchard,
and along this Bert guided the steady old<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>
horse. On either side were men and women
up on ladders picking the peaches, and Bert
felt that they were all looking at him as he
went along.</p>

<p>“Go on there, Tramper!” he called to the
horse. But the patient old animal did not
pay much attention to anything. He never
went a bit faster for all Bert’s talk.</p>

<p>The lad guided the horse and cart safely
out on the main road, and along that to the
lane which led to the barn where the sorting
was going on.</p>

<p>As Bert hoped, Nan and the smaller twins
were in the doorway and saw him coming.</p>

<p>“Oh, look at Bert!” cried Flossie.</p>

<p>“He’s driving a real horse!” added Freddie.</p>

<p>“So he is!” exclaimed Nan.</p>

<p>Bert “began to put on airs,” then, as his
father said later. But just as he was urging
the horse up the little slope that led into
the barn, Bert saw a turtle crawling across
the lane in front of him. The wheels of the
cart would almost surely pass over the
turtle’s shell, crushing it.</p>

<p>“Look out there, Mr. Mud Turtle!” cried
Bert. But the turtle, like all of its kind,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>
was a slow mover. It did not get out of the
way.</p>

<p>Bert pulled sharply on the left rein to turn
the horse and swerve the cart. But he pulled
too hard. The horse turned too suddenly,
and the cart began to tilt to one side.</p>

<p>“Oh, Bert!” screamed Nan, who was
watching.</p>

<p>Then, before he could swing the animal
the other way, over went the cart, Bert,
peaches, and all in a grand upset.</p>

<p class="ph3">FLOSSIE’S BEAR</p>


<p>Mr. Bobbsey, who had gone to the barn
before Bert left the orchard driving Tramper,
now ran out of the building, somewhat
alarmed and fearing his son might be hurt.
But Bert had been thrown a little distance
from the cart and had landed safely on a
clump of soft grass at the side of the lane, so
he wasn’t hurt at all.</p>

<p>As for Tramper, he didn’t seem to mind it
in the least. He just stood still when he felt
something wrong happening, and he let the
cart go over. In fact, he could not have
stopped it had he wished.</p>

<p>“Bert, why in the world did you turn so
sharply?” asked his father, as he ran over to
pick up the boy. But Bert did this for himself.
“You shouldn’t have made such a sudden
turn,” went on Mr. Bobbsey.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span></p>

<p>“I know it—now,” Bert ruefully answered
as he looked at the peaches scattered over the
ground. “But I turned so I wouldn’t run
over a mud turtle.”</p>

<p>“Well, of course that was a kind thing to
do,” went on his father. “But a slower turn
might have saved the turtle and also saved
the cart from upsetting. However, it can’t
be helped now.”</p>

<p>“Bert tipped over! Oh, Bert, you tipped
right over, didn’t you?” gasped Flossie.</p>

<p>“I sure did,” answered her brother, trying
to smile.</p>

<p>“And you spilled the peaches, didn’t you?”
went on Freddie. “Didn’t you spill the
peaches, Bert?”</p>

<p>“I guess anybody can see that,” Bert
said.</p>

<p>“What will Mr. Watson say?” asked Flossie.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” answered Bert. “But
you two run into the barn now and I’ll pick
’em up.”</p>

<p>“We’ll help,” kindly offered Flossie.</p>

<p>“’Course we will!” added her twin brother.</p>

<p>“It won’t take long with all of us helping,”
put in Nan.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span></p>

<p>Mr. Bobbsey, with the help of some of the
men who were sorting peaches in the barn,
turned the cart over on its wheels again, and
then began the work of tossing back into it the
spilled peaches.</p>

<p>“No great harm done,” said the man in
charge of the sorting. “These are bruised
peaches anyhow, and a few more knocks
won’t make ’em any worse. It’s a good
thing you were driving Tramper instead of a
livelier horse, my boy,” he continued, “or
he might have run away when he felt the cart
going over.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I’m glad Tramper stood still,” Bert
rejoined. The horse had begun to eat grass
after the accident, as much as to say that it
wasn’t his fault and he didn’t care how long
they took to load the cart again.</p>

<p>But at last the spilled fruit was gathered
up and once more Bert mounted the seat and
took the reins. For Mr. Watson, arriving
from a distant orchard and hearing about the
accident, had said that Bert was to try
again.</p>

<p>“You might as well learn now as any time
not to turn a wagon too suddenly,” he said
kindly to the boy. “Get up and try again.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>
I’ll watch you and tell you if you turn too
short.”</p>

<p>So Bert had a lesson in driving, and he was
glad Mr. Watson had not been angry because
of the upset. But the farmer knew that
young people must have a chance to learn,
and so he was patient.</p>

<p>“Whoa!” called Bert, as he drove Tramper
into the barn with the load of soft fruit and
stopped the cart where Mr. Watson told him
to. Then the fruit was put into wooden
bins and the sorting went on.</p>

<p>“Do you want to bring in another load?”
asked the farmer.</p>

<p>“Do you think it safe to trust him?” inquired
Mr. Bobbsey. “I don’t want him to
make a lot of work for you.”</p>

<p>“He can’t hurt the soft peaches much,
anyhow,” the farmer went on, “and there’s
nothing like letting a boy know how to
handle a horse. He’ll be safer with Tramper
than any other animal. Go on, Bert, drive
back to the orchard and get more peaches.”</p>

<p>“Could we ride with him?” begged Flossie.</p>

<p>“Oh, let’s!” called Freddie.</p>

<p>“Well, we’ll all go,” said Mr. Bobbsey.
“I used to know how to drive a horse, and if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>
Bert gets into any trouble I can help him out.
But don’t upset this load, son,” he warned
with a laugh, as he put the small twins into
the cart, while he helped Nan up and then
got in himself. They sat on boards placed
across the high sides of the cart.</p>

<p>“I’ll be very careful,” promised Bert.</p>

<p>The turtle, which had been the innocent
cause of the other accident, crawled off in the
high grass around the barn. Bert started
Tramper back on the trip to the orchard, and
this time he made the return with a load of
peaches in safety, driving proudly into the
barn, almost as well as one of the men could
have done.</p>

<p>The barn and the orchard were now busy
places, for Mr. Watson wanted to get as
much fruit to market as he could while the
weather was good. He expected to make
two or more pickings, as more and more
peaches were ripened by the sun. And the
earlier he could haul his fruit to market the
more money he would get.</p>

<p>“It’s the early fruit that sells best,” he
said.</p>

<p>The sorting went on in the big barn, basket
after basket of choice yellow and red peaches<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>
being packed, covered, and set in a cool
place, ready to be taken the next day on the
big truck to Hitchville. There there was
quite a large peach market, where buyers
came from the big cities miles away to bargain
for the fruit.</p>

<p>“And we’re going there to-morrow!” sang
Flossie that night, after a day of fun, part
of which was spent in the peach orchard.</p>

<p>“Are we going to take Baby May—I mean
Baby Jenny?” asked Nan of Mrs. Watson.</p>

<p>“No,” was the answer. “She will be better
off at home. I have told your father that
Jenny and I are sorry to decline his nice
invitation to go along. But when she gets
as big as you I expect she will help her father
gather the peaches,” she added, as she
cuddled the baby in her arms.</p>

<p>The next day was a fine one, the sun shining
down from a sky of blue with white clouds
floating here and there like sailing ships.</p>

<p>“Well, everything looks well for a big
peach crop,” said Mr. Watson, as the truck
was started off on the road to Hitchville.</p>

<p>As the truck would have to travel more
slowly than the faster pleasure car, Mr.
Bobbsey would not leave Cloverbank for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>
several minutes yet. At the end of this
time the Bobbsey twins and their father and
mother were on the highway, over which they
had come a few days before in the driving
rain storm.</p>

<p>“You take the children out to the peach
market, and I’ll do some shopping,” Mrs.
Bobbsey told her husband. “You can stop
for me on the way home.”</p>

<p>The peach market was in a big open lot
near a railroad siding, on which stood many
freight cars. Even before the children
reached the place they could smell the sweet
perfume of the peaches.</p>

<p>And such a busy place as the peach market
was! At first Bert and the others could make
little of it. There were so many motor and
horse-drawn trucks, so many men shouting
back and forth, so many freight cars with an
engine puffing up every now and then to haul
them away—there was so much confusion
that the Bobbsey twins did not know what it
was all about.</p>

<p>A man would jump up on a box or a barrel
and shout something. Other men would
shout something back at him. Then they
would wave their hands, they would write<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>
down something on pieces of paper, and
move away. Then the same thing would
happen in another place.</p>

<p>“What are they doing?” Nan asked her
father.</p>

<p>“Selling loads of peaches by auction to the
highest bidder,” was the answer. “There is
Mr. Watson—watch him.”</p>

<p>The children saw their farmer friend
standing up on the seat of his big motor truck,
which was piled high with baskets of peaches,
some of which the children had picked.
About Mr. Watson’s truck were gathered a
number of men, some of whom were lifting the
edges of the covers over the baskets to look
in at the kind of peaches grown at Cloverbank.</p>

<p>Then followed much talk and shouting,
until at last Mr. Watson was heard to exclaim:</p>

<p>“Sold! Where do you want them?”</p>

<p>“Take them to that car!” directed a man,
hurriedly writing something on a piece of
paper and giving it to the farmer.</p>

<p>“Mr. Watson has just sold his load of
peaches,” explained Mr. Bobbsey. “Several
buyers offered different prices for them, after<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>
seeing what fine fruit he had, and Mr. Watson
sold to the man who would give him the most
money. He will now put his peaches into a
freight car and later they will be hauled by
the engine to some distant city. There they
will go to what is called a wholesale dealer.
He has bought them here, through his agent
or a commission man, as he is called. The
wholesale man will sell them to stores and the
stores will sell them to people who want a
quart or a single basket. That is how the
peach business is carried on.”</p>

<p>“When I grow up,” said Freddie, as he
looked at all that was going on, “I guess I’ll
be a peach-man instead of a fireman!”</p>

<p>“Oh, so you’ve changed your mind, have
you?” laughed his father. Ever since he
was a small lad Freddie had said, many
times, that he was going to be a fireman. No
toy pleased him more than a little engine or a
hook and ladder truck. But now he seemed
to have a different idea. “Well, we’ll see—when
you grow up,” laughed his father.</p>

<p>They had lost sight of Mr. Watson now,
but guessed, as was the fact, that he had gone
to unload his truck load of peaches into the
box car. Soon they saw him again, his truck<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>
empty, and he waved his hand to them and
called:</p>

<p>“Back now for another load!”</p>

<p>“Good luck to you!” wished Mr. Bobbsey.</p>

<p>After remaining a little while longer to
view the busy scenes in the peach market
the Bobbsey twins were taken back to Hitchville,
where they met their mother, who had
finished her shopping.</p>

<p>“Well, did you have a good time?” she
asked.</p>

<p>“Fine!” answered Bert.</p>

<p>“And I was going to be a peach-man. But
I guess I’ll be a fireman like I always was,”
Freddie told her.</p>

<p>“Perhaps that will be best,” his mother
agreed, with a laugh.</p>

<p>Back to Cloverbank drove Mr. Bobbsey
and his family, and there they found the
picking and sorting of peaches still going
on.</p>

<p>“Let’s watch ’em sort peaches in the barn,”
suggested Bert.</p>

<p>The work was now going on faster, for Mr.
Watson wanted to take advantage of the
good weather and the high prices fruit was
bringing. After a while Flossie and Freddie,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>
in the spirit of investigation, wandered down
to a lower floor of the big barn.</p>

<p>“What place is this, do you s’pose, Freddie?”
asked the little girl, as she pointed to a
small door in the side wall.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” Freddie answered.
“Maybe it’s a sort of icebox, where Mr.
Watson keeps peaches over night.”</p>

<p>“Maybe,” Flossie said. “I’m going to
look in and see.”</p>

<p>She tried to open the door, but it stuck, and
she called to Freddie to help her. Together
the children managed to open it, the workers
in the barn paying little attention to the
twins, for there was no work going on near
this door. No sooner was the door opened,
allowing Flossie to enter a little way, than she
gave a scream and cried:</p>

<p>“Oh, there’s a bear here! Look at the
bear! Oh, Freddie!”</p>

<p>She darted back so quickly that she
knocked Freddie down.</p>

<p class="ph3">NAN’S TROLLEY RIDE</p>


<p>“What’s that you said, Flossie? Where
are you going?” asked Freddie, scrambling to
his feet.</p>

<p>In her excitement over what she had seen,
Flossie had screamed in such a shrill voice
that her brother hardly understood her.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter? What are you
running for?” he called to her.</p>

<p>“I guess you’d run yourself, if you saw a
bear!” panted Flossie. She could not run
very fast, for the passage, like a wooden
tunnel, was covered on the bottom with wisps
of hay, and that made it slippery.</p>

<p>“A bear!” gasped Freddie. “Did you
see a bear?”</p>

<p>By this time he and Flossie had gotten out
of the passage and were back in the big barn,
on the other side of the small door they had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>
opened. There was no one else near them,
none of the peach workers, nor was Bert nor
Nan. The small twins had this part of the
barn to themselves.</p>

<p>“Yes, it was a bear,” declared Flossie, not
so excited, now that she saw a door between
herself and the beast. “It wasn’t a very big
bear,” she added. “Just a little bear.”</p>

<p>“I’m going to look!” declared Freddie, for,
unlike his sister, he was not afraid of wild
animals like bears, wolves, and lions. At
least, Freddie said he wasn’t.</p>

<p>“Oh, you mustn’t go in there!” exclaimed
Flossie, when she saw her brother about to
open the small door. “The bear will get
you! We’d better go tell Daddy or Mother.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe there’s a bear in there,”
asserted Freddie. “How could a bear get
here, anyhow? Bears don’t eat peaches.”</p>

<p>“Well, maybe they eat hay, and there’s
lots of hay in this barn,” Flossie said. “And
I heard Mr. Watson say he was going to
put more in soon. Maybe the bear wants
hay.”</p>

<p>“Bears don’t eat hay,” went on Freddie.
“They eat people. But I’m not afraid of a
bear—anyhow, not of a little bear. And I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>
don’t believe there’s a bear here. They stay
in the woods.”</p>

<p>Flossie knew that, as a rule, bears did do
this. But she was sure she had seen some
queer beast. So she ran to Freddie as he was
trying to open the door and cried:</p>

<p>“Don’t go in! Don’t go in! If it wasn’t
a bear it was some terrible wild animal!
Let’s run!”</p>

<p>But Freddie wanted to show off before his
sister, to prove how brave he was.</p>

<p>“The bear won’t hurt me!” he insisted.
“You stay back there, Flossie, but I’ll open
the door and look at him. And if it’s a big
bear I’ll go call Mr. Watson. He has a gun—I
saw it in the house.”</p>

<p>Flossie got ready to run farther back in
the barn, and Freddie was tugging at the
door, which had swung shut rather tightly,
when he was spared the trouble of opening it.
The door opened itself! Or perhaps something
on the other side pushed it open, and the
two children saw a strange beast staring at
them. It was a creature with a black, bushy
head, and at the sight of it Flossie cried:</p>

<p>“There! It is the bear! It is the bear!
Now you’d better run, Freddie Bobbsey!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, it’s a bear all right!” gasped the
boy. “And it’s a big one, too! I’ll go get
Mr. Watson and his gun!”</p>

<p>The two children ran out of a side door of
the barn. Some distance away from that
part of the building where the peaches were
being sorted they saw Zeek, the hired man,
walking toward them.</p>

<p>“Oh, there’s a bear in here!” screamed
Flossie.</p>

<p>“A big bear!” added Freddie, as if that
explained why he was also running. For he
didn’t want it known that he would retreat
from a small bear.</p>

<p>“What’s that you say?” asked the hired
man. “A bear?”</p>

<p>“In the barn,” added Flossie.</p>

<p>“He came out of the little door,” went on
Freddie.</p>

<p>“Oh, you mean in the fodder tunnel,” said
the hired man. “Well, there can’t be a bear
there.”</p>

<p>“But we saw him!” insisted Flossie.</p>

<p>“And he had a black, bushy head,” explained
her brother.</p>

<p>Zeek, laughing and shaking his head,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>
entered the barn, followed by the two
children.</p>

<p>“Hadn’t you better get a gun?” asked
Freddie.</p>

<p>“No, I guess your bear will come and eat
out of my hand,” said Zeek.</p>

<p>“Oh, is he a trained bear?” Flossie wanted
to know. She was not frightened now, and
Freddie’s courage, also, came back to him.
Zeek did not answer, but led the way to the
fodder tunnel door. The children followed
him.</p>

<p>Then, just before reaching the place, they
were startled by a loud:</p>

<p>Maa-a-a-a!</p>

<p>“There’s your bear,” chuckled Zeek. A
moment later a half-grown calf ran toward
him and Flossie and Freddie! But it was
not like any calf the children had ever seen.
Its head was large and black and bushy.</p>

<p>“What makes him look so queer?” asked
Freddie, as the calf, again uttering its maa-a-a
cry, began nosing Zeek’s hand as if seeking a
taste of salt, of which all cattle are very
fond.</p>

<p>“Why, this calf has been roaming around<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>
the pasture lot,” explained the hired man,
“and he’s got a lot of burdock burrs and other
stickers all over his head. No wonder he
looked like a bear. My, but you are a sight,
Sukie!” he said to the calf, to which, he
explained later, he had given that odd name.
“I’ll have to get a curry comb and brush and
clean you up,” he went on, as he began pulling
the burrs from the animal’s shaggy head.</p>

<p>“Is that all it was—a calf?” asked Flossie.</p>

<p>“That’s all,” said Zeek.</p>

<p>“It looked like a bear,” Freddie remarked.
Both children, but especially Freddie, felt
a little disappointed, now their fright was
over, to find that their “bear” was only a
calf.</p>

<p>“I haven’t the least doubt of that,”
chuckled Zeek, in answer to Freddie’s remark.
“He’s got a head almost as big as a buffalo’s.”</p>

<p>This was true. Sukie had rambled into one
briar and burr patch after another. Then he
had found his way down near a lower part of
the barn connected with the fodder tunnel.
The calf had gotten into this tunnel, which
was used as a passage way from one part of
the building to another. And, pushing along,
the calf, with his head looking like a “bear”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span>
as Flossie thought, had confronted the little
girl.</p>

<p>When she and Freddie ran back into the
main barn, the calf followed them, and, hoping
to get something to eat, possibly, had
pushed the door open.</p>

<p>“It will be a week before you look like
yourself again,” said Zeek to the calf. “But
I suppose you didn’t know any better. Well,
I’ll turn you out where you belong,” and he
led the calf to a side door, and a little later
the children saw the hired man using a curry
comb on the creature.</p>

<p>Never was there such a jolly place to have
fun as Cloverbank. Not only was there the
big farmhouse with its attic containing many
wonderful things, but there were barns, an
ice-house, a smokehouse, and many other
buildings where all sorts of games could be
played. The attic alone would keep the
children busy two or three rainy days at
least, Mrs. Watson said.</p>

<p>But, as yet, the Bobbsey twins had done
no more than peer into the delightful attic.
While the sun shone they wanted to be out of
doors, and for the first week of their visit to
the farm the weather was fine. It was just<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>
what was needed to allow the peach crop to
be gathered.</p>

<p>In the days that followed the experience of
Flossie and Freddie with the “bear,” the
children often visited the orchards, where
they helped pick the red and yellow fruit.
At other times they would help sort it in the
barn, and once they rode with Zeek to the
canning factory with a load of soft peaches
which must quickly be made up into marmalade
lest they spoil.</p>

<p>One day, when a lull came in the hard-and-fast
work of picking and sorting the peaches,
Nan, passing through the kitchen, saw Mrs.
Watson getting ready to make some biscuits.</p>

<p>“Oh, may I do that?” begged Nan. “I
know how! Mother showed me! Didn’t
you?” she asked Mrs. Bobbsey who just
then came into the kitchen.</p>

<p>“Yes, Nan bakes very good biscuits,” was
the answer.</p>

<p>“I’d be glad to let her bake mine,” returned
Mrs. Watson. “The baby is so fretful
to-day she doesn’t want me to leave her.
So go ahead, Nan; and I wish you luck.”</p>

<p>“You’d better wish her something else,”
put in Bert, with a laugh.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span></p>

<p>“What do you mean?” asked Jenny’s
mother.</p>

<p>“I mean you’d better wish that Flossie
doesn’t sit down in the batch of biscuits,”
Bert went on. “Flossie did that to Nan’s
biscuits the time we were keeping house last
winter,” and he explained what had taken
place, as has been related in the book before
this one.</p>

<p>“That will never happen again!” said Nan.
“I’ll watch where I put the pan of biscuits,
and I’ll watch Flossie. She won’t sit in any
more of them!”</p>

<p>“Well, in that case, I’ll let you do the
baking,” promised Mrs. Watson, and soon
Nan was in her element. She loved to cook
and she really knew how to make very good
biscuits. And as Flossie and Freddie were
playing at sailing boats down in the brook,
the little twin girl and boy did not appear
on the scene to cause trouble.</p>

<p>Nan’s biscuits came out of the oven a lovely
brown, and when Mr. Watson asked for a
third helping of them at the table when
supper was served, Nan felt just a little bit
proud, as well she might.</p>

<p>“The best biscuits I ever ate, except those<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>
my wife makes!” said the farmer, with a
laugh.</p>

<p>Mr. Bobbsey had to return to Lakeport
to see about some business matters, but he
planned to return to the farm as soon as he
could. He would have to make trips back
and forth that way all during the summer,
he told his family.</p>

<p>It was the day after Mr. Bobbsey went
away that Nan strolled out to the large barn
in time to see a big wagon loaded with hay
drive into the yard. She saw several men,
a horse, a long rope, and what looked like a
big iron letter U turned upside down near
the hay wagon.</p>

<p>“What’s it all about?” asked Nan.</p>

<p>“That’s the hay fork and unloading trolley,”
explained Zeek, who was busily hurrying
to and fro. “You see we have such a lot of
hay that some of it has to be stored in the top
story of the barn. It would take too long
to carry it up, one pitchfork full at a time,
so we have this hay fork. It’s like the letter
U turned up, as you see, and on each of the
legs, as you might call them, are prongs which
fold up when they aren’t in use. A man jabs
the two ends of the U down into the hay.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>
Then he pulls on a rope and that makes the
prongs stick out and they hold a big bundle of
hay.</p>

<p>“Then the horse starts walking along the
ground and he pulls the hay fork full up to the
top of the barn over a pulley wheel. The
horse does most of the work, you see, and we
can put in a lot of hay in a short time.”</p>

<p>Nan watched as the fork took up what
seemed to be a quarter of the load on the
wagon, and then, as the horse pulled, up the
mass of dried grass rose in the air.</p>

<p>Then it rolled along by means of a grooved
trolley wheel on a tight rope until it reached
the open door of the second story of the big
barn. Into the door went the mass of hay,
and a man there pulled on another rope,
loosening the prongs in the legs of the U and
the hay fell out. Then the empty fork
coasted back down the inclined stretched
rope until it was at the wagon again.</p>

<p>Nan found this very interesting to watch,
and in order to see better she climbed up to
the top story of the barn and found herself
in the hay mow which was being filled.</p>

<p>“Hello! who’s there?” asked Zeek, as he
heard some one behind him. Zeek had gone<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>
up to empty the hay fork after each full
trip.</p>

<p>“I came up to watch,” said Nan.</p>

<p>“All right—stand over there and you’ll be
safe,” said the hired man.</p>

<p>As one wagon was emptied of its load in
this quick fashion, another drove into the
yard, and the fork began taking the hay
off that. Then some one called Zeek away
and Nan was left alone in the mow. As she
stood there the horse on the ground below
started off, raising a fork full of hay and pulling
it toward the open mow door.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear!” exclaimed Nan. “Here’s a
lot of hay coming and no one to open the fork.
I wish I could do it. I think I could. I
watched Zeek. All he does is to pull the
short rope. I’ll do it!”</p>

<p>And so, when the fork full of hay swung
into the barn, Nan made a jump for the
dangling short rope and pulled on it. But the
hay fork did not open. Something was
caught, or jammed. Nan fairly lifted herself
off the ground in her eagerness to pull, and
hung dangling by the rope fast to the fork full
of hay.</p>

<p>Just then Zeek, who had gone out of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>
barn, looked up and saw the fork full of hay
in the open door.</p>

<p>“What did you haul that up for?” he
asked the man, who was driving the horse.
“I’m not there to open the fork!”</p>

<p>“Oh,” said the man, “I didn’t know
that. I thought you were there. I’ll let
the hay come back again!”</p>

<p>He spoke to the horse. The animal began
backing, and the big bundle of hay began to
roll down the inclined trolley rope.</p>

<p>As it came out of the barn Zeek and the
others were startled to see Nan Bobbsey
clinging to the rope. Before she could let
go she was being given a dangerous hay
trolley ride out of the barn, high in the air
over the yard.</p>

<p>“Oh! Oh!” gasped the little girl, as she
realized her plight.</p>

<p>“Hold on! Hold on!” shouted Zeek.
“Don’t let go and you’ll be all right in a
minute! Hold on!”</p>

<p class="ph3">BERT’S WATER MILL</p>


<p>Nan Bobbsey was sure of one thing—and
this was that she was going to hold with
all her might to that rope attached to the hay
fork. To let go, now that the fork was out of
the barn and over the open yard, would mean
a bad fall. So the girl clenched her fingers
around the rope and set her teeth. It was a
little “scary,” she said afterward, to look
down to the earth, though, as a matter of fact,
it was not more than twenty feet below her.
But that is quite a fall to take.</p>

<p>However, Nan’s danger was soon over.
The horse backed so that the laden fork and
the girl came back over the wagon load of
hay, and then Zeek cried:</p>

<p>“You can let go now! You’re all right.”</p>

<p>Nan could see this for herself. She saw
that her feet dangled a little way above the
big pile of hay on the wagon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span></p>

<p>She opened her fingers and dropped into
the mass of sweet-smelling grass with a sigh
of relief.</p>

<p>“She’s all right—not hurt a bit!” reported
Zeek, who began climbing up to Nan as soon
as he saw that she was safe. “What made
you catch hold of the fork in the barn?” he
asked.</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know,” answered the little
girl, who was almost crying. “I shouldn’t
have done it, I know. But I saw that the
hay wasn’t going to drop and I had seen you
pull the short rope, so I thought I could do it.
But it didn’t work, and before I could let go
I found myself carried out of the barn.”</p>

<p>“The hay fork prongs got jammed,” explained
the man in charge of unloading the
wagon. “First time I’ve known that to
happen.”</p>

<p>Bert, who had been out in a workshop
which Mr. Watson had in one of the barns,
saw from Nan’s face that something had
happened when he noticed her walking out
of the barnyard, and when he learned what it
was he exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Jimminy, it’s a good thing you held fast,
Nan!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, I knew I must do that,” she said.
“But what’s that, Bert?” she asked, for she
saw that her brother had been “making
something,” as he called it.</p>

<p>“It’s going to be a water mill if I ever get
it finished,” he replied.</p>

<p>“You mean a mill to turn by water?”
asked Nan.</p>

<p>“Yes, it’s a sort of water wheel,” explained
Bert. “But maybe I can make it so
it will turn a fan, or something like that.
I’ll put the wheel, with paddles on, down in
the brook where there’s a little waterfall,”
he went on. “Then I can have a belt of
cord that goes around a pulley wheel on the
paddles. And up at the house I can make
a fan with another pulley on it. And when
the water turns the paddle and pulley it will
also turn the fan and we’ll get a breeze on a
hot day.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’ll be fine!” cried Nan.</p>

<p>“It will if it works,” replied Bert, more
practically. “I made one last year and it
didn’t work. Anyhow, this one is going to be
better. I’m going to try the paddle wheels
now—I’ve got that much done. Want to
come and see it work?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span></p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Nan eagerly. “I do
hope it works, Bert!”</p>

<p>“So do I,” he said.</p>

<p>The brook ran down at the lower end of
the kitchen garden of Cloverbank. Along
the bank of this stream the Bobbsey twins
loved to play. The water was not deep
enough, except in a few places, to make it
venturesome play, and the children had been
told to keep away from these spots.</p>

<p>“But we have to go to one of the deep
spots now, to make this paddle wheel work
and try my water mill,” Bert said. “The
only place where the water tumbles over the
rocks enough to turn the paddle is where it’s
deep. But we’ll be careful.”</p>

<p>“Yes, we’ll be careful,” agreed Nan. “And
Mother won’t mind our going there if it’s to
try your mill. For she likes to be cool, and
maybe she will like your fan, Bert.”</p>

<p>“Maybe,” he assented. “But I haven’t
got the fan part done yet—just the water
mill paddle part.”</p>

<p>As Bert and Nan made their way to a little
waterfall in the brook, they heard the shouts
of Flossie and Freddie, who had gone some
time before to sail toy boats.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span></p>

<p>“They’re having a good time,” remarked
Nan.</p>

<p>“It sounds so,” agreed her brother.</p>

<p>But just then there was a shrill scream from
Flossie, and Freddie’s voice could be heard
shouting:</p>

<p>“Oh, there he goes! Now he’s in!”</p>

<p>Bert and Nan looked at each other with
alarm. They heard a splashing of water.</p>

<p>“One of them has fallen in!” gasped Nan.</p>

<p>Guided by the shouts of the smaller twins,
the older ones soon reached the place where
Freddie and Flossie had been playing. As
they neared the spot they heard laughter
mingled with the shouts.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe either one of them fell in,”
said Bert, as he slowed up a bit to wait for
his sister.</p>

<p>“It sounded so,” she said. “And we heard
them say so.”</p>

<p>Wondering what had happened to cause
the splashing, the two hurried on and, pushing
their way through the bushes that
fringed the edge of the brook, Bert and Nan
saw their brother and sister standing on
the shore. But there was something in the
water that excited them, for they were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>
running up and down poking long sticks into
the brook.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” called Nan.</p>

<p>“Did anybody fall in?” Bert wanted to
know.</p>

<p>“Just an old big bullfrog!” was Freddie’s
unexpected answer.</p>

<p>“Oh, he was such a big, fat frog!” added
Flossie. “Did you hear the splash he made?”</p>

<p>“I should say we did!” replied Nan. “We
thought maybe it was one of you.”</p>

<p>“No,” Freddie said. “But I almost fell
in trying to stop the frog from getting away.”</p>

<p>“Did you catch him? What happened?”
asked Bert.</p>

<p>“We almost caught him,” replied Freddie.
“We were sailing our boats, and Flossie saw
the frog. He was up on the bank, asleep in
the sun.”</p>

<p>“And Freddie said for us to get between
him and the water and drive him farther up
on the bank and then maybe we could catch
him,” added Flossie. “So we tried to creep
up so he wouldn’t hear us. But he has good
ears, I guess, for he woke up and began to
hop toward the water.”</p>

<p>“Frogs always do that,” explained Freddie,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>
as if he knew all about such creatures.
“We tried to chase him back with sticks, but
he just kept on jumping this way and that
way, trying to get into the brook again, and
then—then——” Freddie had to stop and
laugh at the memory of what had happened,
so Flossie finished the story by saying:</p>

<p>“The big frog hopped close to Freddie and
Freddie thought he could grab him and he
stooped over, Freddie did, and the frog
hopped right between his legs—I mean between
Freddie’s legs—and splashed into the
brook. That’s how he got away.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” added Freddie, still laughing,
“that’s how he got away. And I fell over,
’cause I made such a quick grab for him.
But I didn’t hurt myself,” he added, “and
I didn’t get much muddy—only a little.”</p>

<p>“I should say it was more than a little,”
laughed Nan. “But I guess it won’t matter
on your old clothes.”</p>

<p>“No, it won’t matter any,” decided Freddie.</p>

<p>“After the frog got in,” went on Flossie,
“we tried to poke him out with long sticks,
but he won’t poke at all.”</p>

<p>“I should think he wouldn’t,” chuckled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>
Bert. “He’s glad to get away from you two.
I guess he’s deep down in the mud now,
laughing at you.”</p>

<p>“Well, I almost had him,” was what
Freddie said. Then he saw the pieces of
wood Bert had and asked: “What’s that—a
water wheel?”</p>

<p>“Sort of,” Bert admitted. “I’m going to
try to make a water mill to run a wooden fan.
I’m going down to the waterfall to try it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, may we come?” begged Flossie.</p>

<p>“You may if you will promise to sit down
on the bank and not come near the edge, for
it’s deep there!” insisted Bert.</p>

<p>“We’ll sit down all the while. Won’t we,
Flossie?” asked her small brother, and she
nodded her head vigorously in answer.</p>

<p>“Well, I guess it will be all right to take
them,” decided Nan.</p>

<p>A little later the four Bobbsey twins were
at the place where the brook splashed noisily
over a ledge of rocks, falling a distance of
about two feet. It made a fine place to set
up a water wheel, and Bert was soon fastening
his in place so the falling stream would turn
the paddles. If these worked he intended
connecting them by means of a string belt and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span>
pulleys to a fan set up some distance away.
But he had yet to build the fan.</p>

<p>Bert drove into the earth bank on one side
of the little waterfall some pieces of wood to
which he intended fastening his water mill
paddle. He had finished this and was about
to set up the wooden wheel when Flossie gave
a startled cry.</p>

<p>Though he knew he had left his little sister
sitting safely on the bank some distance away
from the water, Bert felt that she might have
gone too near the edge and might be sliding in.</p>

<p>“Look out!” he cried, dropping the wheel
and turning around. Before he knew it, he
set one foot on a slippery place on the bank.
The next instant Bert felt himself sliding
down toward the deep pool below the falls.</p>

<p>“Here I go!” he shouted wildly.</p>

<p>Bert could swim. Still, he did not want
to fall in if he could help it, and he clutched
desperately at the grassy bank.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV</h2>
</div>

<p class="ph3">IN THE APPLE ORCHARD</p>


<p>“Bert! Bert! Hold on!” screamed Nan.</p>

<p>“I—I am holding on—all I can!” her
brother answered.</p>

<p>But desperately as he clutched at the grass
and ground, it was of no use. They were
both wet, for Bert had splashed water around
when he was working to fix his wheel in place,
and farther and farther down the slope he
slid.</p>

<p>“Oh, he’ll be drowned!” yelled Flossie, as
she saw what was going to happen.</p>

<p>“No, I won’t drown!” called Bert, in reply.
“But I’m going to get wet! Here I go!” he
shouted, and then into the pool he plunged,
going in over his head, for the falling water
had washed out quite a hollow place.</p>

<p>“I’ll get him! I’ll help him out!” cried
Freddie, making a dash toward his brother.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span></p>

<p>“You stay right where you are, Freddie
Bobbsey!” insisted Nan, catching the little
fellow before he could reach the edge of the
brook. “Bert can look out for himself, and
we don’t want two in the water at the same
time. Keep back!”</p>

<p>Freddie had to obey, whether he wanted to
or not. But there was really no need of his
help in getting Bert out, for the older lad
could take good care of himself in the water.</p>

<p>He held his breath as he felt himself going
under, and then, as he came up, as one always
does after the first plunge in, he shook his
head, to clear his eyes of water, and struck
out for the bank, only a short distance away.</p>

<p>“Are you all right?” asked Nan, as he
climbed out, dripping water all over like a
big dog that has gone in to bring back a stick.</p>

<p>“Sure, I’m all right,” said Bert, gasping a
bit, for he had swallowed a little water.
“Not hurt a bit. Only my clothes will need
drying.”</p>

<p>“I should say they would!” laughed Nan.
“If you had your fan going now you could
start it and stand in front of it. Wind dries
clothes very fast.”</p>

<p>“Well, I haven’t got my fan, and I came<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>
near not having my water wheel,” said Bert.
“I fell on it when I slipped. I hope I didn’t
break it.”</p>

<p>More concerned about his latest “invention,”
than about himself, Bert went back to
the waterfall, his shoes making a queer
“sloshing” sound, as Freddie called it, for
they were half full of water. He found the
water wheel pulled a little out of place, for
in his excitement when he found himself
falling, he had made a grab for it.</p>

<p>“But I can easily fix that,” he said, and he
got a hammer, some nails and bits of wood
from a box he had brought down to the brook
together with his paddle wheel.</p>

<p>“You aren’t going to keep on at that now,
are you?” asked Nan, in evident surprise.</p>

<p>“Why not?” Bert wanted to know.</p>

<p>“Because you’re all wet. You ought to go
up to the house and get dry clothes on.”</p>

<p>“No,” said Bert. “If I go up Mother
might not let me come down again. Besides,
these are the oldest clothes I have and I
couldn’t play around again until they dried.
They’ll dry on me just as well as off me. I’m
going to keep ’em on and stay right here.”</p>

<p>“But you’d better take off your shoes and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span>
stockings,” Nan advised him. “They’ll dry
quicker off you than on you.”</p>

<p>“I guess that’s a good idea,” Bert agreed,
and soon his footwear was placed on bushes
out in the hot sun, and he resumed work on
his water mill.</p>

<p>Nan looked after Flossie and Freddie so
they would not get in Bert’s way nor into the
brook, and soon the older Bobbsey boy gave
a cry of delight.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” Nan called.</p>

<p>“She works! She works!” he responded.
“Look at my paddle wheel turn!”</p>

<p>Indeed it was splashing around bravely
under the dashing water that came over the
rocks. Around and around went the wooden
blades, just like the larger wheel in a big mill
that grinds grist for the farmers.</p>

<p>“Now all I have to do,” said Bert, as he
and the others watched how regularly the
paddles turned, “is to make my fan and then
connect it with this water mill by a string
belt on the two pulley wheels. Then we can
sit down on the porch and we’ll keep cool by
the fan which will be turned by this water
wheel.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Bert!” exclaimed Nan, “you can<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>
never make the fan run so far away from the
brook.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I can,” he declared. “I can have a
long string belt, and it will work fine!”</p>

<p>But when he came to try it Bert found
many difficulties in the way. True, the pulley
wheel on the paddles turned around all
right, and when the boy tried it with a short
string belt this, too, went circling around as
he held the farther end out on a smooth stick.
But when he came to use a longer piece of
cord, and even this was only halfway to the
porch, it wouldn’t turn at all.</p>

<p>“The reason for that,” said Mrs. Bobbsey,
who had, meanwhile, come to the brook, “is
that your paddle wheel isn’t powerful enough,
Bert. It takes force to move the string,
which gets wet, you see, and is all the heavier
on that account. But you are wet yourself,”
she went on, noticing Bert’s damp condition.
“What happened?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I just—now—sort of—fell in,” he admitted.
“I’m all right and ’most dry. But
don’t you think my water wheel will turn a
wooden fan up on the porch, Mother?”</p>

<p>“No, son, I think not,” she answered.
“The fan will be too far away, and the water<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>
wheel isn’t powerful enough to turn the long,
wet string and the fan pulley in addition.
But you may try, if you like.”</p>

<p>She knew Bert would learn best by actually
doing what he had in mind, and after a day
of hard work he found that his mother was
right. Though the paddle wheel turned under
the falling water, the long string belt
would not move, and neither would the fan.
Besides, the string got tangled on bushes and
once Freddie reported he found a grasshopper
sitting on it taking a sun bath.</p>

<p>“I guess I’ll just work the paddle wheel in
the water and nothing else,” decided Bert.</p>

<p>“I believe that will be best,” agreed his
mother. “We don’t really need a fan to keep
cool on the porch. There are lovely cool
breezes at Cloverbank.”</p>

<p>Mr. Bobbsey returned from a trip to the
city, and he and the twins and their mother
had another happy day on the farm. There
was so much to do and watch, aside from the
gathering of the peaches, that not an hour
passed without something happening, it
seemed.</p>

<p>One afternoon when Bert and Nan decided
to walk to the post-office to mail some letters<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span>
and postals they had written to their playmates
in Lakeport, they passed the lower
edge of the apple orchard. There they heard
the voice of Flossie.</p>

<p>“Now look what you did, Freddie Bobbsey!”
accused the little girl. “Just look what
you did! Oh, it’s terrible!” and she began to
cry.</p>

<p>“Something’s happened!” shouted Bert,
breaking into a run.</p>

<p>“Sounds so,” agreed Nan. “But, anyhow,
they haven’t fallen into the water, for there
isn’t any around here.”</p>

<p>“Maybe that calf that got all burrs and
stickers is chasing them,” suggested Bert.
“It would be just like Freddie to try to get
up on its back and ride it!”</p>

<p>It was nothing as exciting as this, it turned
out. When Bert and Nan reached the orchard
they saw the two children standing
under one of the trees, gazing up into the
branches, which were laden with fruit just
beginning to ripen.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” asked Bert. “Is
your kite up there, Freddie?”</p>

<p>“No! It’s my doll! And Freddie threw
her up there!” the little girl answered, drying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>
her tears on her dress. “And she won’t come
down and maybe I’ll never have her again.
Oh, dear!”</p>

<p>“What in the world did you toss Flossie’s
doll up into a tree for?” asked Nan of the
little boy.</p>

<p>“I threw her up so she’d bring down some
apples,” was the answer. “We wanted some
apples, and we threw up stones and sticks,
but we couldn’t knock any down, then I
asked Flossie if I shouldn’t throw her doll up,
’cause she’s easier to throw than a stick.
Flossie said yes, so I did.”</p>

<p>“But I didn’t think my doll was going to
stay up there!” objected Flossie. “You said
she’d come down with some apples; that’s
what you did!”</p>

<p>“But how’d I know she was going to stick
there?” asked Freddie. “Anyhow I’ll climb
up and get her down for you.”</p>

<p>“No, you don’t!” cried Bert, catching
Freddie as he was about to climb the tree.
“I see where the doll is. She’s too high for
you to reach. I think I can make her come
down with a long stick.”</p>

<p>Bert found one with which he managed not
only to dislodge the doll, but to bring down<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>
some apples as well, to the delight of the
small twins. Then, restoring her plaything
to Flossie, Bert and Nan took the small ones
to the post-office with them.</p>

<p>When they returned they heard voices in
the dining room of the farmhouse—voices in
excited talk, it seemed—and at the sound of
one voice Bert and Nan looked at each other
in surprise.</p>

<p>“It’s Mrs. Martin!” whispered Nan.</p>

<p>“That’s right!” agreed her brother. “I
wonder if she is crazy again and has come to
take the baby away?”</p>

<p>It was Mrs. Martin who had been left in
charge of Baby Jenny while her parents went
to South America and who had left the little
one on the Bobbsey’s doorstep in the rain
that strange day. And now Mrs. Martin
was at Cloverbank!</p>

<p>What could it mean?</p>

</div>

<p class="ph3">THE RUNAWAYS</p>


<p>“Shall we go in?” asked Nan of her
brother in a whisper, after they had stood outside
the door a few moments, listening to the
voices within the room.</p>

<p>“Well, I guess so—yes,” he replied. Then,
as he listened and heard the sound of laughter
mingled with the talking, he began to believe
that, after all, Mrs. Martin had only called
in a friendly way and not to get the baby
again. “Sure, let’s go in,” said Bert.</p>

<p>Followed by Flossie and Freddie, who did
not understand very much about why the
other two had delayed, the twins entered the
room where the old lady who had acted so
strangely about “Baby May” was seated.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bobbsey and Mrs. Watson were also
there, and so was Baby Jenny, who was being
held by the old lady.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span></p>

<p>“Well, here are the lost twins!” exclaimed
Mrs. Bobbsey, with a laugh, as her four entered.</p>

<p>“Lost! We weren’t lost!” said Bert, in
some surprise.</p>

<p>“I know—I was only joking,” his mother
told him. “You were gone a long time, and
while you were away this friend of yours
called,” and she motioned to Mrs. Martin.</p>

<p>“Do you remember me, my dears?” asked
Mrs. Martin, nodding at each of the Bobbsey
twins in turn.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, ma’am,” answered Nan politely.</p>

<p>Mrs. Martin could tell that the children
were just a little bit afraid of her. It really
was no wonder, for she had acted very
strangely in leaving Baby Jenny in a basket
on the Bobbseys’ steps during a storm and
later stealing the baby away again. Of
course afterward, as you know if you have
read the book, everything came out all
right.</p>

<p>“I am all right now,” the old lady said,
for she guessed that Bert and the others were
looking at her curiously. “You needn’t be
afraid of me, my dears. I am not going to
take this darling baby away any more. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span>
just came to pay a little visit to her. But I
didn’t expect to find the Bobbsey twins here.”</p>

<p>“We’re glad to see you,” was Bert’s polite
remark.</p>

<p>“And we’re glad you’re better,” added
Nan.</p>

<p>“But you look sort of—sort of different,”
said Freddie.</p>

<p>“She looks like—now—like the Grandmother
in Red Riding Hood,” Flossie said,
after a little hesitation over the matter.</p>

<p>Every one laughed and Mrs. Martin said:</p>

<p>“It’s my glasses, I guess. Always, up until
a week ago, I used the kind of glasses that
pinch on your nose,” she told Mrs. Bobbsey
and Mrs. Watson. “Then my eyes began to
get worse and I went to the doctor who said
I needed different glasses, and he wrote out
the kind I should get on a paper.</p>

<p>“I took it to a shop and they made me
these glasses that fasten on over my ears and
stay on better than the nose kind. And I
can see ever so much better. I think it must
be my glasses that make me appear strange
to the children.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I guess it is,” said Nan. “I never
saw you with glasses on before.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span></p>

<p>“Well, I hope you will get used to them,
my dear, and like me,” went on Mrs. Martin.
“I am quite proud of these glasses. I hope
nothing happens to them,” she said anxiously.
“If they got broken or I lost them, I could
hardly see at all, my eyes have changed so.
I am getting old, I guess,” she said, with a
sigh. “But then we all have to do that—even
Baby Jenny is older than when I so
foolishly took her away and left her on your
steps,” she told Mrs. Bobbsey.</p>

<p>“Yes, and my twins are growing up, too,”
said their mother. “Though sometimes,
when they act foolishly, fall into brooks and
ride on hay forks, I fear they are growing
younger instead of older,” she concluded,
with a laugh.</p>

<p>“They can’t be young but once,” Mrs.
Martin said, as she took off her glasses to
wipe them on a piece of silk she carried in her
pocket. Baby Jenny had reached up and
put her fingers on the glass, making a blurred
place. “No, they can’t be young but once—more’s
the pity. Have all the fun you can
when you are little,” she advised the children.</p>

<p>“I guess you don’t need to tell them that,”
said their mother.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span></p>

<p>Flossie and Freddie went into the yard to
play. Bert and Nan, after having talked a
while longer with Mrs. Martin, also left the
room. Later they learned that Mrs. Martin
had come to stay a week or two with her
cousin, Mrs. Watson.</p>

<p>That evening after supper the Bobbsey
twins made up their minds that they were
going to like Mrs. Martin very much, for she
gathered them about her after the evening’s
play and told them some fine stories. Even
Bert, who liked out-of-door games more than
he did books, was interested in the tales the
old lady told.</p>

<p>“Did somebody tell you that story?” asked
Freddie, after the ending of one he had liked
very much.</p>

<p>“No, my dear, I read it in a book,” was the
answer. “And now that I have my new
glasses, I can read a lot more stories to tell
you.”</p>

<p>“That’s good,” said Flossie. “I hope
nothing happens to your glasses, Mrs. Martin.”</p>

<p>“I hope not, myself,” she said. “If I
lost them or broke them, I would have hard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span>
work to replace them, especially out here
at Cloverbank. Then I couldn’t read any
more.”</p>

<p>The next day was a rainy one—the first the
children had met with since coming to Cloverbank,
though, as you remember, they had
arrived in a hard shower. At first the twins
were rather disappointed when they awakened
and heard the drizzling downpour, for they
had planned a picnic in the woods. But
Mrs. Bobbsey, seeing their unhappy faces,
laughed and said:</p>

<p>“This is just the kind of day to play in the
attic!”</p>

<p>There was a bookcase in the attic, and in
it Nan found some old children’s books that
had belonged to Mr. Watson’s mother when
she was a little girl.</p>

<p>“And such funny, funny stories about such
very proper little girls I never before read,”
Nan told her mother afterward.</p>

<p>There were trunks full of old clothes, and
Flossie dressed up in these. There were some
ropes, too, and the boys fastened these to the
rafters and did—or Bert did and Freddie tried
to do—all sorts of acrobatic tricks. There<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span>
was old furniture, and chairs and tables were
pulled out and made to do for a house, a
steamboat, and a train of cars in turn.</p>

<p>After dinner Mrs. Watson pleaded with
Mrs. Bobbsey that the boys be permitted to
put on overalls and the girls old dresses and
run out in the rain to play. Mrs. Bobbsey
thought the children might catch cold, but
Mrs. Watson laughed and said that such a
warm summer rain would never hurt running
children, if they came in and dried themselves
as soon as they stopped playing.</p>

<p>So out in the falling rain rushed Nan and
Bert, Freddie and Flossie, and such a game of
tag as they had, the smaller twins not always
being caught, either! Then came a jolly
game of puss-wants-a-corner, with trees for
corners. After this they went in the house
again and, after putting on dry clothing, went
back to the attic for the rest of the afternoon.</p>

<p>Before the Bobbsey twins knew it the
rainy day had passed and night had come.
They had spent many happy hours in the
attic, and running about in the rain. Then
came an evening story by Mrs. Martin, and
soon it was bedtime, even for the older twins,
Bert and Nan.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span></p>

<p>“Well, I’m glad to see the sun,” said Mr.
Watson the next morning after breakfast.
“I was afraid it was going to rain and I
couldn’t get the rest of my peaches picked.
But this is a fine day.”</p>

<p>As soon as the orchard had dried up a little,
the men and women peach-gatherers appeared,
and soon there were the same busy
scenes that the visitors had observed when
they first came to Cloverbank.</p>

<p>As more pickers came to work than he expected,
Mr. Watson soon found that a great
quantity of fruit was gathered in the barn to
be sorted, and this must be done quickly, so
the baskets could be hurried to the market
to be sold.</p>

<p>“I’ll come out and help you sort,” offered
Mr. Bobbsey, who had returned from his trip
to the city.</p>

<p>“So will I,” his wife said.</p>

<p>“We will, too!” exclaimed Nan and Bert.</p>

<p>The small twins offered their services, but
as it was doubtful whether or not they could
tell choice fruit from that intended for the
near-by canning factory, their mother decided
they had better play about the barn
while the others sorted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span></p>

<p>The barn was soon a busy place, with the
small truck and wagon bringing in the fruit
from the orchard, and the sorters picking out
the different grades. The whole place had a
most delightful perfume about it from the
crushed peaches, for, in spite of care, some
would fall and be bruised, quickly getting
soft.</p>

<p>Bert and Nan soon learned to do good work
at the sorting bins, watching what the expert
workers did, and Mr. Watson, pausing near
them once or twice, said they were doing very
well. Mrs. Bobbsey, knowing a lot about
peaches, for she had canned many of them,
was able to work with the best of them. Nor
was Mr. Bobbsey far behind.</p>

<p>“I’m glad you Bobbsey folks came out to
Cloverbank,” chuckled the farmer, during a
lull in the work. “I never had such a big
crop of peaches before, and good workers are
scarce.”</p>

<p>“We’re working for our board,” Mrs.
Bobbsey said, with a laugh. “And that reminds
me, Mr. Watson! Your wife said she
would like you to send a few baskets of
peaches to the house, as some friends of hers
are going to stop for them during the day.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span></p>

<p>“I’ll have Zeek take out some ripe ones,”
was the answer, and this was done, the baskets
of peaches being set on the porch of the
farmhouse.</p>

<p>It was just before noon, and Bert and Nan
were having a race to see who could sort the
most peaches, when suddenly there arose a
great shouting outside the barn.</p>

<p>“What’s that?” exclaimed Mrs. Bobbsey.</p>

<p>“Maybe somebody else upset a load of
peaches,” suggested Bert.</p>

<p>But Freddie, who was near the open door
of the barn, began to dance in excitement at
something he saw.</p>

<p>“They’re running away! Oh, look at the
runaways!” he cried.</p>

<p>“Are the horses running away?” asked his
father, for Mr. Watson was using a team to
haul wagonloads of peaches in from the
orchard.</p>

<p>“No, it isn’t horses! It’s cows! A lot of
cows running away! They’re coming right
into the barn, too! Oh, look!”</p>

</div>

<p class="ph3">MRS. MARTIN’S GLASSES</p>


<p>For a moment or two, following Freddie’s
excited cries, those in the barn, including the
others in the Bobbsey family, did not know
whether the little fellow really saw what he
said he did or not.</p>

<p>“What do you mean, Freddie—are there
really runaway cows?” asked Nan.</p>

<p>“Sure, they are!” was the answer. “Come
and look! They’re running right this way,
too!”</p>

<p>“And I can hear cows, too!” shrieked
Flossie.</p>

<p>“I’ll see what’s going on!” exclaimed Zeek
Trimmer from his place at the far end of the
peach bins, where he was putting the fruit
into baskets ready for the market.</p>

<p>He ran to the door, followed by Mr. Watson
and Mr. Bobbsey. Freddie had turned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span>
to find what he thought would be a safe place
with Flossie. Nan decided she must help
her mother quiet the small twins, but Bert
ran on with his father and the other men.</p>

<p>Flossie was right when she said she could
hear the cows, for loud bellows and moos filled
the air, mingling with the shouts of men.</p>

<p>Bert looked out in time to see a large herd
of cattle rushing up the lane that led from the
main road to the biggest of the Cloverbank
barns. The animals seemed to have been
frightened by something, and were now running
away, or “stampeding,” as a Western
cowboy would have called it.</p>

<p>“Where’d they come from?” asked Mr.
Bobbsey. “Are they your cattle, Mr. Watson?”</p>

<p>“No, they don’t belong to me. I haven’t
as many as that. They must be a herd some
drover was driving to market, and they got
wild for some reason or other.”</p>

<p>“Well, if we don’t shut these doors they’ll
be in the barn in another minute!” cried
Zeek. “And if they knock over the peach
baskets and bins and trample the fruit, there’ll
be a big loss. Help me close the doors!” he
shouted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span></p>

<p>“That’s a good idea!” exclaimed Mr. Bobbsey,
and while some of the peach sorters ran
out to help the drover and his men quiet the
runaway cattle, others began closing the big
doors of the barn.</p>

<p>By this time the excited cattle were all
about the building, running this way and
that, kicking up their heels, shaking their
horned heads, and acting wildly.</p>

<p>“They’ll break down my fences and let out
my cattle if we don’t drive them away!” said
Mr. Watson, when he, with Mr. Bobbsey and
the other men, had gone outside, after closing
the doors to save the peaches.</p>

<p>“Help me get ’em back into the road and
they’ll be all right!” shouted a man with a
long whip. He evidently was in charge of the
herd, and had two other men to help. “Drive
’em back into the road!” he cried.</p>

<p>“What happened?” Mr. Watson wanted to
know.</p>

<p>“Dogs and bees!” was the answer. “A
stray dog started one of the heifers off on a
run. She got in among some bee hives down
the road and kicked over some of the hives.
The bees swarmed out and stung a lot of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span>
cows, and they got wild and started to run.
Then the whole bunch started off!”</p>

<p>“We’ll help you get them back into shape
again,” said Mr. Bobbsey.</p>

<p>“Can’t I come?” asked Bert, who was
eager to do his part.</p>

<p>“Yes, come along!” invited Mr. Watson.</p>

<p>“This is fun!” exulted Bert, as he caught
up a stick to wave at the cows and get them
back on the main highway.</p>

<p>It may have been fun for Bert Bobbsey,
but it was worrisome work for the drover and
his men. But finally the bunch of runaway
cattle were rounded up, and they were slowly
driven out of the lane, away from the peach
barn, and toward the main road. Some of
Mr. Watson’s cattle, in a near-by pasture,
seeing the other bunch of animals, seemed to
want to join them. They ran excitedly up
and down the field, as close to the fence as
they could get.</p>

<p>“If they break out you’ll have hard work
separating your cows from the others,” said
Mr. Bobbsey to the farmer.</p>

<p>“I guess they won’t break out,” was the
reply. “My fences are good and strong.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span></p>

<p>It was well they were, for some of the cows
tried to knock the rails down with their heads
and horns. But the barriers held, and when
the runaway cattle were driven back to
the highway, the Cloverbank cows quieted
down.</p>

<p>Bert did good work, running here and there
after stray animals and preventing them from
turning back up the lane again. The cows
did not seem to know what to do nor where
to go.</p>

<p>“Bees and a barking dog are a bad combination
in a herd of cattle,” remarked Mr.
Watson, when the drover was thanking him
for having helped to get the animals started
on their way again. “It’s a good thing your
animals didn’t overrun my farm.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I’m glad they didn’t do any damage,”
said the other. “Though I would have
been willing to pay for it if they had.”</p>

<p>“I mean I’m glad they didn’t get among
my bee hives,” went on Mr. Watson. “A
second stinging would have made them wilder
than ever.”</p>

<p>“I guess it would!” agreed the drover.
“But I don’t see any hives around here,” he
added.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span></p>

<p>This was the first Bert knew honey was
produced on the farm.</p>

<p>“Yes, I have quite a few swarms of bees,”
replied Mr. Watson. “They’re over in that
valley,” and he pointed to a distant one the
children had not yet visited. “There’s lots
of clover around here, and clover blossoms
make the best honey,” he said. “Though
some folks like the strong black honey made
from buckwheat blossoms, and some say basswood
honey is good. But clover suits me.”</p>

<p>“Was anybody hurt?” called Mrs. Watson
to her husband. She stood on the side porch
of the house, holding Baby Jenny, and with
her was Mrs. Martin.</p>

<p>“Nobody hurt,” her husband answered.
“Did any of the cattle get up around the
house?” he asked, for he had been so busy
driving away those near the barn that he had
noticed little else.</p>

<p>“There were a few up here,” Mrs. Martin
said. “They acted just like they wanted to
come into the house.”</p>

<p>“Maybe they wanted to give some milk
to the baby,” suggested Freddie.</p>

<p>“Well, they didn’t get a chance!” cried the
old lady. “I caught up the broom and drove<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span>
’em away. Then they headed for the garden,
and I had to go after ’em again!”</p>

<p>“You must have had quite a time up here,”
said Mr. Bobbsey.</p>

<p>“We did,” Mrs. Watson said. “For a
little while I thought surely some of the cows
would come into the house. What happened?”</p>

<p>She was told about the bees and the dog.</p>

<p>What might have been a serious matter
passed away safely, though the runaway
cattle were the cause of something happening
a little later to Mrs. Martin.</p>

<p>The stampede had interrupted the peach
sorting, but no damage had been done, and
Mr. Watson said Freddie had been a “brave
little scout,” to warn so quickly about the
danger of the onrushing cattle.</p>

<p>“If they’d once got into the barn here,
among my fruit, they would have done a lot
of damage,” the farmer said. “You are quite
a cowboy, Freddie!”</p>

<p>“No, I’m going to be a fireman when I
grow up,” was the answer. “Once I was
going to be a cowboy, but my sister Flossie
doesn’t like cows, so I’m going to be a fireman,
and she can come and see me put out fires.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span></p>

<p>“I didn’t know you kept bees, Mr. Watson,”
said Nan, when quiet was once more
restored in the barn.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” he said. “I bought some from a
man who didn’t make much of a success producing
honey for the market. I left the bees
over where he had them—that’s the reason
you’ve never seen the hives around here.”</p>

<p>“Will there be some honey soon?” asked
Freddie.</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t wonder but what there
would,” was the answer. “Anyhow, there
will be plenty in the fall, and I’ll see that you
get some to eat on your pancakes this winter.
I’ll send you some.”</p>

<p>“I like pancakes!” murmured Freddie.</p>

<p>Knowing that too much work would not
please the children, Mr. Bobbsey suggested
that they had been in the barn long enough,
sorting peaches, and told them to run out and
play.</p>

<p>This Flossie and Freddie did, going to their
favorite place down by the shallow part of
the brook, where they sailed tiny boats.
Bert and Nan, after having really helped
quite a bit in sorting the fruit, wandered off
to the woods, Nan taking a story book.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span></p>

<p>Bert decided he would go fishing.</p>

<p>“Want to come, Nan?” he invited, for he
liked to have his sister with him.</p>

<p>“Thank you, I guess I don’t,” she answered.
“I’ll take my book back to the house and
read in the hammock.”</p>

<p>Bert went back to the house with her to get
his pole and line. When they arrived they
saw Mrs. Martin excitedly walking about the
porch, looking on window sills, under chairs,
and in many places.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” asked Nan.</p>

<p>“Is the baby lost?” Bert wanted to know.</p>

<p>“Not the baby, but my glasses!” answered
the old lady. “Oh, dear! I had them just
before the runaway cattle appeared, and I
must have taken them off and laid them
some place. Now I can’t find them! And
I’ve gotten so used to them I don’t know
what to do without them! Oh, where are my
glasses?” and she seemed much distressed
over the loss.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

</div>

<p class="ph3">THE QUEER CLOUD</p>


<p>“We’ll help you look for your glasses,
Mrs. Martin,” offered Nan, though she
wished very much to finish her story. “Won’t
we, Bert?”</p>

<p>“Sure, we will,” he answered, boy-fashion.
And, though he very much wanted to go
fishing, he gave up his pleasure for the time
being to help the old lady.</p>

<p>Mrs. Martin was really quite distressed
about losing her glasses, as most people are
whose eyes are so poor that they cannot see
well nor read without the help of spectacles.</p>

<p>“Where did you have them last?” asked
Nan, as she had often heard her mother ask
when one of the children lost a toy.</p>

<p>“I had them on my head, over my nose,
and in front of my eyes,” Mrs. Martin answered.
“Then, all of a sudden, I heard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span>
Mrs. Watson cry out about the cattle coming
into the garden, and I grabbed off my glasses
to get the broom. I was afraid I’d break
them chasing after the cows.”</p>

<p>By this time Mrs. Watson, who had been
putting the baby to sleep, came out on the
side porch.</p>

<p>“Yes, I saw your glasses on you just before
the cattle began running wild,” said Jenny’s
mother. “Then so much happened all at
once that I don’t know what you did with
them.”</p>

<p>“Maybe they’re still up on top of your
head,” suggested Bert. “Once Charlie Mason’s
grandmother lost her glasses and we
looked all over for them, and, all the while,
she had them pushed up on top of her head.”</p>

<p>“Well, mine aren’t there,” Mrs. Martin
replied, putting up her hand, however, to feel
and make sure. “I don’t see what I did with
them!”</p>

<p>Then the search began, with the older
Bobbsey twins and Mrs. Watson helping.
The porch was searched carefully, and the
children looked on the ground around it, stepping
carefully so they would not tread on and
break the glasses if they should have happened<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span>
to fall. But the glasses could not be
found.</p>

<p>Then Mrs. Bobbsey came and helped, but
she was no more successful than the others
had been. Inside and outside the house the
search went on, but the spectacles could not
be found.</p>

<p>“Maybe they’ll turn up after a while,” said
Mr. Watson, when he came in from the peach
sorting to get washed for dinner.</p>

<p>“Well, I hope they will,” his wife’s cousin
said. “Meanwhile I can’t read a word, and
I can’t see very well. I declare, I can hardly
tell one Bobbsey twin from the other!” she
said with a sigh.</p>

<p>“We can tell you our names,” Freddie suggested.
He and Flossie had come back from
sailing their toy boats and had taken part in
the hunt for the glasses.</p>

<p>“Yes, my dear, that’s kind of you, and I
suppose you could do that,” murmured the
old lady. “But I would like to see.”</p>

<p>When a further search did not bring the
missing glasses to light Mr. Watson said:</p>

<p>“Can’t you mail the prescription to the
people who made them and have another set
made?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, I could do that if I had the prescription,”
agreed Mrs. Martin. “But I haven’t
got that paper. I lost it. If I only had it
things wouldn’t be so bad, for it would mean
only a few days before I could order new
spectacles by mail. But I’ve lost the prescription.”</p>

<p>“Your doctor has a copy,” Mr. Watson
said. “Eye doctors always keep copies of the
prescriptions they give their patients.”</p>

<p>“Probably Dr. Bangert has a copy of
mine,” Mrs. Martin agreed, with a sigh.
“But he has gone away on his summer vacation
and I don’t know where to reach him.
When he gave me the prescription he told me
to take good care of it, as he was going away
and could not be reached until the fall. I
think he has gone hunting in the wilds of
Canada.”</p>

<p>“Then it looks as if you would either have
to go to another doctor around here and get
him to fit you with glasses,” said Mr. Watson,
“or else find those that are lost.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want to go to another doctor,”
said Mrs. Martin. “I don’t believe anybody
but Dr. Bangert could fit my eyes. Oh, I must
find those glasses! They can’t be far away.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span></p>

<p>“Maybe they got caught on one of the horns
of the cows and carried off,” suggested Freddie.</p>

<p>“You think of the funniest things!”
laughed Mrs. Watson. “But the cows didn’t
come near enough the porch to take my cousin’s
glasses. She must have dropped them
in some out-of-the-way corner.”</p>

<p>Though once again they searched all over,
even in places where Mrs. Martin said she
had never been with her glasses, the spectacles
could not be found and she was quite in
despair.</p>

<p>Having done all he could to help the old
lady, Bert decided that he would spend the
afternoon fishing, for he was fond of this
sport and Mr. Watson had said that in a
creek across the meadow from the brook there
were good fish to be had.</p>

<p>He had brought his fishing outfit with him,
so that all he needed now was some bait, and
on the advice of Zeek he took both worms and
grasshoppers. The worms he and his brother
and Nan dug in the garden, putting the crawling
creatures in a baking-powder box, with
some earth. To give the worms air Bert
punched holes in the top and bottom of the
tin box.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span></p>

<p>“Sometimes when the fish won’t bite on
worms they will on grasshoppers,” suggested
the hired man. “Just take another box with
you and walk through the lower hay meadow.
The grasshoppers are thick there. You can
catch them in your hand as you walk along
and pop them in the box. But you want
to be careful how you do it.”</p>

<p>“Why, will grasshoppers bite?” asked Bert,
though he had never heard of them doing that.</p>

<p>“No,” answered the hired man, with a
laugh. “But after you catch one grasshopper
and put it in the box, when you take
off the cover to put in another, often the first
one will jump out. And you can’t catch
many fish on one hopper.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I see what you mean,” laughed Bert.</p>

<p>He found it just as Zeek had said. It was
easy enough to grab a green grasshopper off
a head of timothy grass in the hay field, but
when he caught his second one and opened
the box cover to slip the creature in, out
jumped the first one.</p>

<p>But Bert made a prisoner of the second one,
and when he had his third he was more careful
in opening the box. He raised the lid
only a little way, and through the crack<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span>
he shoved the green insect. Soon he had
enough, he thought, with the worms he had
brought, and he made his way to the edge
of the creek, picking out a spot where the
water foamed and bubbled over the stony
bottom.</p>

<p>As worms were easier to put on the hook
than the grasshoppers, which were very
lively, Bert baited with one of the crawling
creatures and cast in his hook. The Bobbsey
boy was about as patient as most lads, but
when he had pulled out several times, thinking
he had bites, and found nothing on his
hook, Bert began to think perhaps it would
be well to change the bait.</p>

<p>He opened his other tin box to get one of
the grasshoppers, but no sooner was the lid
raised than, with one accord, every grasshopper
in the container leaped out and sailed
away.</p>

<p>“Well—say—that wasn’t very polite!”
laughed Bert. “Still, I can’t blame you!” he
went on. “I guess it isn’t much fun to be
stuck on a hook and swallowed by a fish.
I’ll catch my grasshoppers right here, one at
a time, as I need them,” he said.</p>

<p>He had noticed that in the field just back of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span>
the place he had picked out for fishing, many
grasshoppers were jumping from weed to
weed. Bert laid aside his pole, having noted
that the worm had been nearly nibbled off
the hook now by small fish, too little to land,
and, going back, he caught a grasshopper in
his hand.</p>

<p>“Now for a big fish!” said the lad.</p>

<p>But after waiting some time and getting no
bites, Bert was inclined to think that he had
chosen a wrong spot or else that his bait or
the day was wrong. His first guess was
borne out a little later when a voice hailed
him, saying:</p>

<p>“You’ll never get any fish there!”</p>

<p>Bert Bobbsey turned and saw a country
lad of about his own age standing on the edge
of the weed-grown field. The boy was barefooted,
his clothes were ragged, and he had a
torn straw hat on his head. Over his shoulder
was a crooked stick cut from a tree, and fastened
to it was a line with many knots in it,
as if it had been broken and tied a number of
times.</p>

<p>“Why won’t I get any fish here?” asked
Bert.</p>

<p>“’Cause there aren’t any there—it’s too<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span>
shallow. If you want to get big ones you’ll
have to go up above to the eddy, where the
water’s deep.”</p>

<p>“Well, I must say I haven’t had much luck
here,” admitted Bert. “I’ve tried worms
and grasshoppers, and the only bites are little
nibbles.”</p>

<p>“Those are just baby fish. They suck off
the bait without getting caught on the hook,”
said the country lad. “Come on with me
if you want to, and I’ll show you a good
place.”</p>

<p>“Thanks,” answered Bert. “Do you live
around here?”</p>

<p>“Yes, just over that hill. My name’s
Sam Porter. What’s yours?”</p>

<p>“Bert Bobbsey,” was the answer.</p>

<p>“You live around here?” asked Sam.
“I never saw you before that I know of.”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t live here,” Bert said. “I’m
visiting at Cloverbank.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I know Mr. Watson!” exclaimed
Sam. “My father works for him. He’s
picking peaches now.”</p>

<p>Sam proved to be a nice lad, and he and
Bert soon became good friends, talking about
fishing and other outdoor sports. Sam led<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span>
the way up the bank of the creek to a quiet,
shady spot beneath some overhanging willow
trees.</p>

<p>“There’s the eddy,” he said, pointing to
where the water ran deep and quiet. The
stream had washed out a place in the earth
bank, making a deep pool where the water
swirled around in a circle, or “eddy,” as the
country lad called it. On the other side of
the creek, opposite this point, the stream was
shallow and ran rapidly over the stones.</p>

<p>“But the big fish come to this pool,” Sam
said. “You’ll soon have a big one!”</p>

<p>He was right. Bert had only thrown his
worm-baited hook in the water and waited a
few minutes before the bobber on his line
dipped suddenly under water.</p>

<p>“You’ve got him! A big one!” whispered
Sam. “Pull up!”</p>

<p>Neither Sam nor Bert were doing fishing in
a scientific way with a reel, and the only way
to land a fish, once he was hooked, was to
pull up the pole quickly.</p>

<p>This Bert Bobbsey did. He felt a weight
on his bamboo rod, and as it went in a sweeping
circle over his head he had a glimpse of
something flashing like silver in the sun.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span></p>

<p>“You got him! A beauty!” yelled Sam.
“A big one!”</p>

<p>When Bert ran to look in the grass, where
he had landed his catch, he was delighted to
find that he had caught a good-sized chub,
as Sam named the fish.</p>

<p>“Say, you brought me to a good place all
right!” cried Bert in delight to his companion.
“There’s fish here all right! I hope
you get one!”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ll get one all right,” said Sam. “I
hardly ever come here without getting as
many as we can use at home. My mother
likes fish, and about twice a week I come
here to get a mess.”</p>

<p>He had retained his seat on the bank, his
line dangling in the water, while Bert landed
his catch, and he watched the Bobbsey boy
as he took the chub off the hook—which was
not easy to do, since the fish had swallowed
the hook in its eagerness to get the bait.
When Bert had his prize loose, he strung a
string through the gills and then, fastening
on a cross-stick so the fish would not slip off,
he put it back in a little pool, tying the shore
end of the string to a tree.</p>

<p>The chub feebly flapped its tail and tried<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span>
to swim away, but he was held a prisoner.
In the water he would be kept fresh until
Bert was ready to go home with any others
he might land.</p>

<p>Sam caught the next one, tossing back on
the grass a fish not quite as big as Bert’s, but
fair in size.</p>

<p>“Now my luck’s beginning!” exclaimed
Sam, as he fastened his fish to another string
and let it swim about in a pool. His fish had
only been hooked through the lip and was
hardly hurt at all.</p>

<p>The two lads then “took turns,” so to
speak, in landing fish. It was a fine day and
a good place, and first Bert would land one
and then Sam would follow.</p>

<p>“Well, I guess I have enough,” Bert said,
after a while.</p>

<p>“And I have, too,” agreed Sam. “We
might as well clean ’em and wash ’em here
and then there won’t be such a mess around
the house.”</p>

<p>The boys prepared the fish for cooking
and then put them with wet grass in baskets
they had brought for that purpose.</p>

<p>“If you come with me across this field, I’ll
show you a short cut back to Cloverbank,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span>
suggested Sam, when they were ready to
go.</p>

<p>“All right.”</p>

<p>The two boys were going across a green
meadow in a little valley between two low
hills, when Bert suddenly heard a low, humming
sound in the air. At first he thought
it was a distant aeroplane, but on looking
around he saw what seemed to be a small
black cloud coming toward him and Sam.</p>

<p>“Look!” cried Bert, pointing.</p>

<p>“Golly! We’d better duck!” exclaimed
Sam.</p>

<p>He dropped his pole and basket of fish and
began running toward a low clump of bushes,
calling to Bert as he ran:</p>

<p>“Come on! Come on in here until it gets
past!”</p>

</div>

<p class="ph3">HIVING THE BEES</p>


<p>Bert Bobbsey did not understand what
Sam Porter’s excitement was all about. But
he could tell, by the way Sam acted and by
the way he called, that it was something
serious. So he dropped his fish and his pole
and made ready to follow his new chum.</p>

<p>“Come on! Come on!” called Sam, peering
out from his shelter in the bushes, as he
saw that Bert was not hurrying as much as
he might. “Run for it, if you don’t want
to get stung!”</p>

<p>“Stung!” exclaimed Bert.</p>

<p>“Yep,” answered the country lad. “Don’t
you see? That’s a bunch of bees with the
queen bee in the middle, and they’re looking
for a place to settle so they can start a new
home. I only hope they don’t ’light on
this bush,” he added, as Bert crawled in the
shelter with him. “If they do—oh, boy!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span>
Look out for yourself! The best thing to do
will be to leg it for the creek and jump in.
Just let your nose stick out—that’s all! I
hope they don’t decide to settle here where
we are!”</p>

<p>But the swarm of humming, busy little insects,
following their queen, suddenly turned
and made for a tree not far away. There
the bees clustered in a bunch on one of the
low branches.</p>

<p>“That’s good!” cried Sam. “Mr. Watson
can easily get them from there. Come on,
we’ll go tell him!”</p>

<p>The boys picked up their fish and their
poles, and soon they were at Cloverbank.</p>

<p>“Oh, what a fine lot of fish!” exclaimed
Mrs. Bobbsey as she saw the two boys with
their strings.</p>

<p>“Yes, they’re good fish,” Bert said. “But
will you take them, please, Nan. I have to
go with Sam and tell Mr. Watson about his
swarm of bees.”</p>

<p>“What’s this about the bees?” Mrs. Bobbsey
wanted to know. The boys, taking
turns, quickly told her, and Bert added:</p>

<p>“I’m going to watch Mr. Watson catch
them.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, so am I!” cried Freddie.</p>

<p>Nan hurried back to the farmhouse with
the two strings of fish, which were to be put
in the cool cellar until needed. Sam said he
would come back and get his after the bees
were caught.</p>

<p>“So some of my bees got away, did they?”
asked Mr. Watson when he had been told the
news. He was about to set out for another
of his orchards where peaches were being
picked, but when he heard about his honey-makers
he decided to postpone his orchard
trip.</p>

<p>Followed by the Bobbsey twins, their
mother and Sam, Mr. Watson hurried to the
little valley where he kept about a hundred
hives of bees. Like little dog-houses the
hives were, only with flat instead of peaked
roofs, and of course only a small slit was
needed in the bottom of each hive-house to
let the bees fly in and out. The hives stood
in rows in an orchard of apple trees near a
small garden. There was a farmhouse in
this valley in which lived a man and his wife
who looked after the bees.</p>

<p>“I had three swarms out to-day,” called
Jason Stern, the bee-keeper, to Mr. Watson<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span>
when the latter arrived. “I couldn’t get
them all. One got away.”</p>

<p>“I know where it is,” the peach-grower
answered. “Bert and Sam saw the swarm
alight when they were coming back from
fishing. I’ll take an empty hive on the small
hand-cart and bring them back. You’d
better come along to help—that is, if you have
the other swarms safe.”</p>

<p>“Yes, they’re all right except the one that
got away,” said Mr. Stern.</p>

<p>While the Bobbsey twins watched, Mr.
Watson and the bee-keeper put rubber gloves
on their hands and on their heads big straw
hats, the brim of which held the mosquito
netting veil away from their faces so no bee
could get near them. They also tied down
the legs of their trousers.</p>

<p>“For sometimes a bee or two will crawl
up your pants, and it isn’t very pleasant,”
said Jason Stern, with a laugh.</p>

<p>Then a two-wheeled cart with a flat wooden
platform was brought out of the barn and the
party set off.</p>

<p>They presently came in view of the tree
on which the swarm had alighted. The cluster
of bees was like a big football, and somewhat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span>
similar in shape. A low, buzzing sound
could be heard.</p>

<p>“Better not come any closer with the
children,” advised the farmer to Mrs. Bobbsey.
“A stray bee or two might sting them.
You can watch Jason and me from here.”</p>

<p>The mother of the twins, and in fact the
twins themselves, as well as Sam, did not care
to go too near. So they sat down on a grassy
hillock while the two men wheeled the cart
close under the tree. On the cart was an
empty beehive, one of many kept ready for
just such occasions as this. Also, Mr. Stern
had brought with him a “smoker,” which was
something like a tin funnel with a little
leather bellows beneath it. When this bellows
was pumped, clouds of smoke were sent
out of the small end of the funnel. Directed
against the swarm of bees, the smoke quieted
them so they would not sting those who
handled them.</p>

<p>The cart, with the open empty hive on it,
was wheeled up until it was directly under the
branch on which hung the clustering bees
around their queen.</p>

<p>“You hold the cart steady now, Jason,”
directed Mr. Watson, “and I’ll climb up in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span>
the tree and jar them off. As soon as most of
them are inside the hive, clap the cover on.”</p>

<p>“All right,” was the answer.</p>

<p>“I wonder what would happen,” said Bert,
“if the cluster of bees and their queen should
fall on Mr. Stern’s head instead of in the
empty hive.”</p>

<p>“It wouldn’t be very pleasant,” his mother
answered. “Though I guess, with the veils,
the men won’t get stung. But watch now,
children, and see them hive the runaway
bees.”</p>

<p>“Jason, are you all ready down there?”
called Mr. Watson to his bee-man, when the
farmer himself was up in the tree.</p>

<p>“All ready,” was the answer. “Shake ’em
down!”</p>

</div>

<p class="ph3">THE PIRATE’S CAVE</p>


<p>While the Bobbsey twins and Sam, standing
near Mrs. Bobbsey, watched, the peach-grower
suddenly jarred the branch on which
had gathered the runaway bees, clustered
about their queen like faithful subjects.
Down dropped the buzzing brown mass of
honey-gatherers into the open hive box.</p>

<p>“You got most of ’em!” shouted Jason
Stern, as, with a quick motion, he clapped the
cover on the hive and started drawing the
cart away.</p>

<p>“Won’t the bees get out the little front
door?” asked Flossie, for she had noticed
that the hive box had a slit at the bottom.</p>

<p>“I stopped that up before I put the hive
on the cart,” said Mr. Stern. “The bees are
safely caged now—that is all but a few that
got away.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span></p>

<p>The children could see a few of the insects,
which had not fallen into the hive, flying
around the tree and around the white box
that now contained the queen and thousands
of workers. Perhaps these stray bees were
wondering where their monarch had disappeared
to.</p>

<p>“Don’t wheel your cart over toward the
children,” warned Mr. Watson, as he climbed
down out of the tree. “Some of the stray
bees may sting them.”</p>

<p>“I’ll be careful,” said the bee-man. He
puffed into the air around the hive some
smoke from the smoker, and this served to
drive away the humming bees that, after
circling about for a while, flew off in the direction
of the orchard.</p>

<p>“They’ll go back to the old hive,” Mr.
Watson said, as he took off his veil and gloves,
for there was no longer need of them. “And
the bees and the queen in this new hive will
start making the wax cells into which they
will put honey a little later. I’m glad you
saw this swarm and came to tell me, boys,” he
said to Sam and Bert. “It’s worth quite a
few dollars, or will be this fall when the hive
is filled with honey.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span></p>

<p>“I like honey,” remarked Freddie, looking
carefully at Mr. Watson to make sure no
bees had followed him. But none had.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll send you some when you get
back home,” promised the peach-grower.</p>

<p>“That was very interesting,” said Mrs.
Bobbsey as she turned to take the path across
the fields to Cloverbank. “Bees are very
smart little creatures.”</p>

<p>“And they’ll make you smart if they sting
you!” said Bert.</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s a good joke!” exclaimed Nan,
with a laugh. “I’m going to put that in my
composition.”</p>

<p>“You can put in about your brother catching
a big fish, too,” said Sam. “He got the
biggest one of the lot.”</p>

<p>“Oh, did you?” cried Nan. “I’m glad of
that. And I can write about it. Oh, I do
hope I win that prize!” she went on.</p>

<p>“I hate to write compositions,” declared
Sam to Bert. “Don’t you?”</p>

<p>“I sure do,” was the answer. “I’d rather
go fishing any day!”</p>

<p>From a safe distance, when they had gone
back to the little bee-farm, the children
watched the hive of runaways and their captive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span>
queen set down amid the rows of
other busy insects. The piece of wood that
had blocked the “front door” was taken
away and soon the members of the new
colony of honey-gatherers were flying out
and in.</p>

<p>Then Mr. Stern brought out some honey,
from the crop of the previous season, and gave
the Bobbsey twins and Sam a treat.</p>

<p>“Lots has happened to-day,” remarked
Bert, when Sam had gone home after getting
his string of fish from the cellar and the
children were sitting on the porch of the farmhouse,
waiting for the evening meal, which
was almost ready.</p>

<p>“I’m glad of it,” announced Nan, who was
writing with an old, big geography book on
her knees. “I’m making a list of the different
things,” she went on, “and I’m going to put
the best of them in my composition. Tell
me how you felt, Bert, when you pulled out
the big fish.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I felt fine!” he answered, with a
laugh.</p>

<p>“I wish I could catch a fish,” sighed Freddie.
“I’m kind of tired playing with my
fire engine.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span></p>

<p>“I’ll take you fishing to-morrow,” promised
Bert. “I know a dandy place now.
Sam showed me.”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t go to-morrow,” said Mrs.
Bobbsey.</p>

<p>“Why not?” Bert wanted to know.</p>

<p>“Because that’s the day Daddy promised
to take you to the woods for a picnic.”</p>

<p>“Oh, so it is!” cried Bert. “I forgot about
that. We’ll go fishing some other time,
Freddie.”</p>

<p>“All right,” agreed the little boy. “Picnics
are just as nice as fish.”</p>

<p>“Nicer, I think,” Flossie said. “’Cause
you can eat at picnics and you can’t eat
fish!”</p>

<p>“Sure, you can eat fish!” exclaimed Bert.
“What did I catch ’em for if they aren’t to
be eaten?”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t like to eat fish,” Flossie
went on; “so I’d rather have a picnic.”</p>

<p>“We’ll go to-morrow,” promised her
mother.</p>

<p>Mrs. Martin came out on the porch, looking
from side to side anxiously.</p>

<p>“Have you found your glasses yet?” asked
Nan.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span></p>

<p>“No, dearie, I haven’t,” was the answer.
“And I feel quite lost without them. I can’t
read a word. You children haven’t seen
them anywhere, have you?”</p>

<p>None of the Bobbseys had, though, led by
Nan, Flossie and Freddie gave another search
about the house and the side porch. But the
old lady’s glasses seemed to have vanished
completely, and she did not know what to do
about getting another pair.</p>

<p>“I guess I’ll just have to wait until my
doctor comes back in the fall,” she said, with
a sigh.</p>

<p>The next day proved to be a bright and
sunshiny one—just the best kind for a picnic.</p>

<p>Mrs. Watson decided to take Baby Jenny
with them on the outing, and soon after
breakfast she and the little one joined the
Bobbsey family in Mr. Bobbsey’s auto.
They were to go to a glen about ten miles
away, there to spend the day. In the glen,
or little valley between two high, rocky
places, was a waterfall, much larger than the
one in the brook where Bert had placed his
wooden mill.</p>

<p>“I wish I had made a bigger paddle wheel
so I could fasten it under the big waterfall<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span>
we are going to see,” said Bert, when they
were almost ready to start.</p>

<p>“It would have to be a big paddle, for there
is quite a fall in Buttermilk Glen,” Mrs. Watson
said, with a laugh.</p>

<p>“Why do they call it that?” asked Nan.</p>

<p>“Because some one thought the water,
falling over the ledge of rocks, looked like
buttermilk, I suppose,” was the answer.
“Do you want to go to Nan?” the mother
asked Baby Jenny who was holding out her
hands toward Bert’s twin sister. “Well, I
guess you may.” So, to her delight, Nan was
allowed to hold the baby during part of the
auto ride to Buttermilk Glen.</p>

<p>Baskets of food had been packed, for the
picnic was to last all day and they would eat
in the woods, the prospect of which gave the
twins joy and delight.</p>

<p>“We’ll have more peaches picked ready
for you to sort when you get back,” Mr.
Watson called to the picnic party as they
drove away. “I never had such a big crop.”</p>

<p>“We’ll help you to-morrow,” promised
Bert.</p>

<p>Buttermilk Glen was soon reached. It
was a picnic ground well known for miles<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span>
around, though when those from Cloverbank
arrived they had the place to themselves.</p>

<p>“I hear the waterfall!” cried Freddie as
soon as they alighted from the auto at the
entrance to the glen. The road was too
rough to drive all the way up into the
place.</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s it,” said Mrs. Watson. “It’s
very pretty when the water is high; and in
winter, when it freezes, it is even more beautiful.
But I know some one who is sleepy!”
she went on in a singing voice.</p>

<p>“I’m not!” quickly cried Flossie. “I
didn’t come here to sleep.”</p>

<p>“She means Jenny,” whispered Nan, and,
sure enough, the little one’s head was nodding
and her eyes were closing. Her mother
wrapped Jenny in a blanket and put her down
under a tree, while Mr. Bobbsey got out the
lunch baskets and the Bobbsey twins scattered
here and there to play.</p>

<p>“You may have fun for about two hours,
and then we’ll eat,” said Mrs. Bobbsey.
“After lunch you may play about some more
before we start for home.”</p>

<p>With shouts of delight the boys and girls
began exploring the picnic ground. They<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span>
had never been there before, and there was
much to see and admire.</p>

<p>“We’ll climb up the sides and get to the
top of the waterfall after lunch,” Bert decided.
“Maybe I can fish up there. It’s a
big fall—too big for my little paddle wheel
in the brook. But maybe I could make a
big wheel that would turn here.”</p>

<p>A path led up one side of the cliff a little
distance below the fall, and up this, Mrs.
Watson said, the children could make their
way to the top of the fall.</p>

<p>But there was plenty to see down below, and
what with exploring, finding pretty stones,
and wading barefooted in little pools, the
four had lots of fun.</p>

<p>After a time Bert and Freddie found themselves
some distance up in the glen, which
divided into two parts—one where the stream
ran down the center, and another part where
it was dry. Flossie and Nan had gone back
to their mother and father, who sat talking
with Mrs. Watson.</p>

<p>“Look, there’s a cave!” suddenly exclaimed
Freddie, pointing to a dark opening
in the rocky side of the gorge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span></p>

<p>“So it is!” agreed Bert. “A regular
pirate’s cave, I’ll say! Let’s go in!”</p>

<p>Freddie hesitated a moment. The place
looked dark and not very inviting.</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t guess I want to,” Freddie
said.</p>

<p>“Well, I’m going in,” Bert declared. “I
want to see what’s there. Nothing can hurt
you,” he went on. “Even if a pirate was
there once he’s gone now.”</p>

<p>“You go in first, and then maybe I will,”
Freddie suggested. So Bert disappeared
into the blackness. Freddie was just going
to ask if everything was all right when
Bert suddenly shouted:</p>

<p>“Oh! Oh! I’m falling! Oh, Freddie!”</p>

<p>Then the older boy’s voice died away and
Freddie was left alone, outside the pirate’s
cave.</p>

<p class="ph3">FLOSSIE’S TARTS</p>


<p>Freddie Bobbsey was a resourceful little
lad for his age. It was not the first time he
and Bert had gone exploring together, nor
the first time something had happened. So
now, instead of rushing into the small cave
after his brother, as many boys or girls might
have done, Freddie turned to hurry back to
his father and mother.</p>

<p>“I’ll go and get somebody to help you,
Bert!” he called. “Maybe if I went in I’d
fall too, ’cause it looks dark! I’ll get help!”</p>

<p>Bert did not answer, and this made Freddie
fear lest something serious had happened.
But even then he knew the best thing to do
was to bring help as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>Back he hurried to the others, running all
the way. Mrs. Bobbsey could tell by the
look on her small son’s face and by his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span>
manner that something unusual had taken
place.</p>

<p>“Where’s Bert?” she quickly asked, for she
remembered that the two boys had gone into
the deeper part of Buttermilk Glen together.</p>

<p>“He’s in the pirate’s cave!” answered
Freddie, panting for breath. “He hollered
something about falling down and then he
didn’t holler any more and I came back to tell
you!”</p>

<p>Instantly there was great excitement.</p>

<p>“In the pirate’s cave!”</p>

<p>“Is he lost?” Flossie wanted to know.</p>

<p>“You did right to come back so quickly
and tell us,” Mr. Bobbsey said. “Do you
know where this cave is?” he asked Mrs.
Watson.</p>

<p>“Yes, I know of a cave,” she answered.
“It isn’t a very large place, nor is it dangerous.
I can’t understand about Bert’s falling.
There are no holes in the place that I know
of, though I haven’t been in it for years.”</p>

<p>“Maybe he stumbled over a ledge and fell,
striking his head,” suggested Mr. Bobbsey, as
he jumped up and went to his coat which was
hanging on a tree near by. He took some
matches from one of the pockets. “I’ll<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span>
make a bark torch to go into the cave and
find Bert,” he said to his wife. “I didn’t
bring the flashlight. Can you show me
where the cave is, Freddie?”</p>

<p>“I can lead you to the cave,” said Mrs.
Watson, noticing that Baby Jenny was still
peacefully sleeping. “Nan, you and Flossie
stay here with her, and your mother and I
will go with your father and Freddie to the
cave.”</p>

<p>Nan and Flossie would have liked to go,
too, to search for Bert, but they said nothing
as they watched the others start.</p>

<p>It did not take them long to reach the place.
Mrs. Watson had often been to the glen on
picnics and she knew all its windings and
turns. Soon they stood in front of the small
cavern which Bert, in common with other
boys, had named “pirate’s cave.”</p>

<p>“Bert! Bert! Are you all right?” his
mother called. But still there was no
answer.</p>

<p>“He didn’t speak to me, after he hollered
about falling,” reported Freddie.</p>

<p>“He must be in a faint, after falling and
hitting his head,” suggested Mr. Bobbsey.
“I’ll go in with the torch and see.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span></p>

<p>“I’m coming, too!” insisted Mrs. Bobbsey,
while Mrs. Watson said she would stay outside
with Freddie.</p>

<p>Bert’s father pulled off some dry bark, and,
twisting it into a torch, set fire to it. This
gave him and his wife light enough to see,
though rather dimly, as they entered the
small cavern. It was just about high enough
to stand upright in, and seemed to be a cave
that had been hollowed out by the washing of
high water in the glen.</p>

<p>Holding the torch before him, Mr. Bobbsey
went inside, followed by his wife. He had
taken only a few steps before he suddenly
cried:</p>

<p>“Stop! Don’t come any farther! There’s
a hole here, and you may tumble in!”</p>

<p>“Is Bert there?” asked Mrs. Bobbsey.
Her husband flashed the torch down and as far
ahead of him as he could, and then he said:</p>

<p>“Yes, he’s here! And he seems to be all
right, too. He’s moving. I guess he was
dazed by the blow on his head. Hold the
torch, Mary, and I’ll lift him out.”</p>

<p>This was done, and a little later Bert, in the
arms of his father, was carried out of the cave,
his mother following with the torch.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span></p>

<p>“Is he all right?” asked Mrs. Watson.</p>

<p>Bert, getting down out of his father’s arms,
answered for himself:</p>

<p>“Sure, I’m all right. What happened,
anyhow?”</p>

<p>“You went into the cave, fell, and hit your
head so hard that you fainted,” his mother
told him, while she parted his hair to look
for a possible cut or gash.</p>

<p>“Oh, I remember now,” Bert said, in a
dazed sort of way, putting his hand to his
head. “I felt myself falling and I yelled to
Freddie so he wouldn’t come in and get in the
hole. Yes, I hit my head all right.”</p>

<p>But it was nothing worse than this, and
aside from a little cut on his scalp Bert suffered
no injury. A drink of water and some
more of the cool fluid on his head soon made
him feel all right again.</p>

<p>“It isn’t safe to go into a dark cave without
a light, unless you know every step of the
way,” warned Mr. Bobbsey, as they went
back to where Nan and Flossie had been left
with the baby.</p>

<p>But before that was done Mr. Bobbsey
explored the cave. He found that the recent
rain had washed out a deep hole near the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span>
entrance, and it was this hole into which Bert
had unsuspectingly stepped.</p>

</figure>

<p>“Some one else may do the same thing,”
Mr. Bobbsey said. “I’ll put some tree
branches in front of the cave as a warning.
Later we’ll make a danger sign to fasten up
over the entrance.”</p>

<p>They found Nan and her sister anxiously
waiting, and the two girls were relieved to
find out that Bert wasn’t hurt much.</p>

<p>Baby Jenny had awakened by this time,
and as it was nearly noon Mrs. Bobbsey and
Mrs. Watson decided to set out the picnic
lunch, which was done on a flat stump within
sight and sound of Buttermilk Falls.</p>

<p>“Don’t eat too much, Bert,” his mother
warned him, as the good things from the
basket were ready.</p>

<p>“Why not?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Because after a blow on the head you
might be made ill if you ate too heartily.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m all right,” insisted the lad, with a
brave little smile, though his head ached
somewhat. “I didn’t know what happened.
I felt myself going down and I yelled and then
I seemed to go to sleep.”</p>

<p>The remainder of the day was passed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span>
pleasantly in the woods. Later the other
children were allowed to peer into the cave
while their father held a torch that illuminated
it.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t want to be a pirate and live
there,” said Nan with a shrug of her shoulders,
as she turned away.</p>

<p>“Pirates don’t mind the dark—they like
it,” said Freddie, as if he knew all about it.</p>

<p>The next day was a busy one, for many
peaches had to be sorted to be taken to the
auction market. The children rode to Hitchville
again, for they liked the busy excitement
of the place. It was well that Mr. Watson
got a good quantity of his fruit over to Hitchville,
for the following day it rained, when it
would not have been wise to transport the
peaches.</p>

<p>The rain storm was a hard one and, for midsummer,
the day was raw and cold. As the
Bobbsey twins could not go out, they
managed to have fun in one of the barns.
Sam Porter, who had gone fishing with Bert
the day the bees swarmed, came over and
taught the children some new games.</p>

<p>He and Bert decided to give a “circus act,”
as they called it. They made trapezes of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span>
bits of harness and some old broom handles
and swung by their legs and arms.</p>

<p>“Watch me do the giant’s turn!” cried
Bert, as he took an especially long swing
on the trapeze. But one of the straps broke,
the end of the trapeze bar slipped down, and
Bert had a fall.</p>

<p>“Oh!” cried the other children, as they saw
the boy drop.</p>

<p>But Bert came to no harm, for the trapezes
were over big, deep piles of hay, and he fell
on one of these piles. Mr. Bobbsey, when
he learned what sort of a game the boys were
playing, had insisted that the hay be piled
under the trapezes, for he was afraid lest they
break.</p>

<p>“It’s lucky that hay was there,” Bert
said. “I know now why they put nets under
the high trapezes in the circus.”</p>

<p>In the afternoon it had not cleared, and
Nan, getting tired of playing in the barn,
went back to the house. She heard Mrs.
Watson saying to Mrs. Bobbsey:</p>

<p>“If I wasn’t so busy I’d make some peach
tarts. There are plenty of soft peaches
that ought to be used.”</p>

<p>“Oh, could I make the tarts?” begged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span>
Nan. “I know how to make biscuits and I
guess I could make tarts.”</p>

<p>“I’ll show you how,” offered her mother,
after Mrs. Watson had said Nan might use
the kitchen.</p>

<p>“And I want to make some, too,” put in
Flossie.</p>

<p>“No, dear, you are too little,” Nan replied.
“But you can watch me, and, when
you get a little older, you will know how.”</p>

<p>“But I want to make some myself,” insisted
Flossie. However, they would not let
her, so she had to be content to sit in a chair
near the kitchen table and watch while Nan’s
mother showed her how to mix the dough and
roll out the crust, cutting it into little circles
which, when filled with cut-up peaches and
baked, would be tarts.</p>

<p>But when Nan had a batch of the tarts
ready to go into the oven, she left the kitchen
a minute, and this was just the chance Flossie
had been waiting for.</p>

<p>“I know how to make peach tarts,” said
the little girl to herself. “I’ll show ’em I can
make tarts just as good as Nan.”</p>

<p>All the things Nan had used were on the
table, flour, milk, mixing bowls, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</span>
like. Flossie sifted some flour into a brown
bowl, poured in some milk, added a little salt
and lard, and then began to stir the mixture.</p>

<p>But she found that the table was too high
for her to reach in comfort, even while standing
on a chair.</p>

<p>“I’ll set the bowl on the floor,” decided
Flossie. “Then I can stir my tarts and then
I’ll cut them out, like Nan did, and put in
the peaches and bake ’em.”</p>

<p>She lifted the bowl off the table and was
climbing down out of the chair when suddenly
she slipped. Just as Nan opened the
door to come back and clean up, she saw
Flossie fall to the floor with the bowl of dough.</p>

<p>Crash! What a sound it was!</p>

<p>“Oh!” cried Nan.</p>

<p>“Oh!” gasped Flossie.</p>

<p>And then you should have seen her!</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXII">CHAPTER XXII</h2>
</div>

<p class="ph3">HOME AGAIN</p>


<p>Poor Flossie Bobbsey seemed to be
covered from head to foot with the dough she
had mixed to make peach tarts as she had
seen Nan doing. Of course there may have
been a few spots on the little girl that were
not covered with the mixture of flour and
water, but there were not many. Flossie
had made her dough “very sloppy,” as Bert
said, and it splattered all about. There was
much on the floor, some on the chair, but most
of it was on Flossie.</p>

<p>“Oh, you poor child! What in the world
were you trying to do?” cried Nan, as she
ran across the room to pick up her little
sister.</p>

<p>“I was—now—I was makin’ tarts!” sobbed
Flossie. “Did I break Mrs. Watson’s mixing
bowl, Nan?” For her eyes were so filled with
flour that she could not see out of them now.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span></p>

<p>“No, the bowl isn’t broken,” answered
Nan kindly. “And I’ll help you clean up,
Flossie. Oh, but it is a terrible mess!” she
sighed.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bobbsey and Mrs. Watson, hearing
the crash of Flossie’s fall, had run to the
kitchen. They could tell at once what had
happened, but Flossie thought it best to
explain.</p>

<p>“I was making peach tarts,” she said.
“But I didn’t finish.”</p>

<p>“Never mind,” soothed her mother, for
Flossie had been punished enough, Mrs.
Bobbsey thought. “You may have some of
Nan’s tarts.”</p>

<p>And when Flossie had been washed and a
clean dress put on her, she was given one of
the first of the tarts from the oven. For
Nan’s baking turned out wonderfully well.</p>

<p>“You’re getting to be quite a cook,”
complimented Mr. Watson at the table a
little later, when Nan’s tarts were served.</p>

<p>“You can put the story of Flossie and her
tarts in your composition, Nan,” suggested
Bert.</p>

<p>“Yes, I guess I will,” was his sister’s
answer. “I hope some more things happen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</span>
around here before we go home,” Nan went
on. “The more things I have in my composition
the better it will be, and maybe I can
win the prize.”</p>

<p>“I’d give some one a good prize if he or she
could find my lost glasses,” sighed Mrs.
Martin. She was still without her spectacles,
though she gave up a large part of each day to
looking for them.</p>

<p>“I guess you’ll have to wait until your
doctor gets back, and then have him write
you a prescription for a new pair,” suggested
Mr. Watson, as he got on the floor to “play
horse” with Baby Jenny.</p>

<p>“I think some one must have taken them,
either by mistake or on purpose,” said the
old lady. “I remember perfectly well that
I had them the day the cattle ran away.
Then I laid them down and some one must
have come in and picked them up.”</p>

<p>“Who would do such a thing as that?”
asked Mrs. Bobbsey.</p>

<p>“Well, some of those cattle men might,”
Mrs. Martin answered. “Those were rough
fellows and they might take a notion to my
glasses. The frames were of solid gold.”</p>

<p>“But all the men who drove the cattle were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span>
young fellows,” said Mr. Watson. “None of
them wore glasses.”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t know,” sighed Mrs. Watson’s
cousin. “I wish I had my glasses,
that’s all I can say.”</p>

<p>The happy days at Cloverbank were drawing
to a close. Mr. Bobbsey planned to take
his family back home in about a week, so
the children could resume their studies at
school.</p>

<p>“But first I must get some more things
to put in my composition,” Nan said. “Are
you going to work on yours, Bert?” she
asked her brother, as she saw him wandering
about the house as if searching for something.
“Are you looking for a pencil and paper?”</p>

<p>“I’m looking for my pole,” he said. “I’m
going fishing with Sam. I have lots of time
to write a composition after I get back to
Lakeport.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” agreed Nan. “I’m going to
write my composition after I get home, but
I want some things to happen here so I’ll have
plenty of incidents, as Miss Skell calls
them.”</p>

<p>In the days that followed the Bobbsey
twins had much fun. They went on picnics<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</span>
to the woods and to Buttermilk Glen, but
Bert kept away from the pirate’s cave.</p>

<p>The children played in the barns, they
helped feed the chickens and gathered the
eggs. Old Speck came off her nest beneath
the barn with a brood of ten little chickens
and was put in a coop near the house.
Flossie and Freddie devoted themselves to
this little family, feeding them and giving
them water every day.</p>

<p>When another crop of hay was gathered,
the twins were allowed to ride on top of the
loads as they were brought in from the field,
though Nan did not again try to operate the
trolley fork. Twice Bert and Sam went
fishing, and once they took Freddie who,
to his great delight, caught a good-sized chub.
But it dropped off the hook when close to the
bank and flapped its way back toward the
creek.</p>

<p>“I’ll get you! I’ll get you!” shouted
the little fellow, and he threw himself on the
fish so vigorously that he slipped and went
into the water himself. But Bert and Sam
soon pulled him out.</p>

<p>The late crop of peaches was being picked
when it was time for the Bobbsey family to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</span>
return home. Mr. Bobbsey had gone to
Lakeport to attend to some business, but was
coming back to drive his family home in the
automobile.</p>

<p>“Only one day more,” sighed Nan, one
afternoon, when word came in a letter that
Mr. Bobbsey would arrive the following
morning and that the twins must be ready to
leave. “Oh, it’s so wonderful here I could
stay forever!”</p>

<p>“So could I,” Bert said. “But at the
same time I’ll be glad to get back home and
see the fellows. We’re going to have a football
eleven this season, and maybe I’ll be
captain.”</p>

<p>“And I suppose I’ll be glad to get home
after I arrive,” said Nan. “Anyhow, I want
to see if I can win the composition prize.
And that reminds me, I want to gather some
yellow flowers I saw the other day and didn’t
know what they were. Miss Skell said we
should put in something about the trees and
the flowers we saw.”</p>

<p>So Nan, taking Flossie and Freddie with
her, went to gather the blossoms, so she
could find out their name, while Bert went on
a last fishing trip with Sam.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</span></p>

<p>Bert came back from his trip with a fine
string of fish which were cooked for the
evening meal. Mr. Watson said he would
miss this treat, as he was so busy he seldom
had time to go to the creek with hook and line.</p>

<p>Early the next morning all was in readiness
for the trip back to Lakeport. The
Bobbsey twins, brown as berries from their
life out of doors, once again put on their
“good clothes,” valises were packed, and the
auto was brought to the door.</p>

<p>“Have you got room for these?” asked
Mr. Watson, pointing to three baskets of
choice peaches on the porch. “I sorted
these out especially for you. They’ll stand
the journey, if you don’t jounce them too
much over the rough roads, and when you
get them home, Nan, you can make some
more tarts.”</p>

<p>“Indeed we’ll make room for the peaches!”
said Mr. Bobbsey. “And very glad we are
to have them.”</p>

<p>“If we could take some bees home, we
could have some honey, too,” remarked
Freddie.</p>

<p>They all laughed at this, and the farmer
said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</span></p>

<p>“I’m afraid it would be dangerous to
carry bees. But in the fall I’ll send you some
honey.”</p>

<p>“Well, good-bye, folks!” called Zeek. “I’ve
got to go back to the peach orchard. We’re
getting in the last load now and I don’t want
anything to happen to it.”</p>

<p>The children and their parents said farewell
to the kind hired man, and Mrs. Martin
called after him:</p>

<p>“If you find my lost glasses anywhere,
Zeek, bring them back with you.”</p>

<p>“I will,” he promised, though of course as
she had lost them around the house, he would
hardly find them in the orchard.</p>

<p>“Good-bye! Good-bye! Good-bye!” was
called over and over again, Baby Jenny
waving her little hand to the travelers.
Then, with a jolly tooting of the auto horn,
the Bobbseys began their homeward journey.</p>

<p>There was no delay and no such experiences
as had befallen them on their trip to Cloverbank,
although there was one detour that
made, for a short time, a little rough going,
and that evening they reached their home in
Lakeport. Dinah and Sam were at the house,
waiting to greet them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</span></p>

<p>“How’s all mah honey lambs?” asked the
fat cook, as she took some of the baggage
Mrs. Bobbsey handed out.</p>

<p>“We’re all well, thank you, Dinah,” said
Mr. Bobbsey. “Did you and Sam have a
good vacation?”</p>

<p>“Jes’ fine!” answered Sam.</p>

<p>“But Ah suah did miss de chilluns!”
murmured Dinah. “Whut all am dis?”
she asked as she saw the baskets in the
car.</p>

<p>“Those are some peaches Mr. Watson
gave us,” said Mrs. Bobbsey.</p>

<p>“I’m going to make peach tarts,” added
Nan.</p>

<p>“I think those peaches had better be
sorted,” observed Mr. Bobbsey. “We went
over a bit of rough road in making that detour,
and some fruit may be bruised.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” agreed his wife. “And
as Mr. Watson told us, a few bruised peaches
in a basket may spoil the whole lot. We’ll
turn them out on the table and sort them.”
This work was begun as soon as the Bobbseys
had rested a little while.</p>

<p>As the last peaches from one of the baskets
rolled out on the table, Nan, looking in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</span>
bottom of the container, uttered a cry,
darted out her hand, and said:</p>

<p>“Look! I’ve found Mrs. Martin’s glasses!”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Martin’s glasses!” exclaimed her
mother. “Where were they?”</p>

<p>“In the bottom of that basket, covered
with the peaches,” said Nan. “Look!”
She held out the spectacle case which, when
it was opened, proved to contain the old
lady’s glasses, not in the least harmed.</p>

<p>“How did they get there?” asked Bert.</p>

<p>No one knew, of course, but it was thought
that the empty peach basket must have been
on the porch at the time of the cattle scare.
Mrs. Martin must either have dropped or,
in her excitement, have put the glasses in the
basket. Later it was set out in the shed, no
one looking to see if it contained anything.
The glasses must have remained in the basket
all the while, and even when the peaches were
put in to be given to Mr. Bobbsey, no one
saw the spectacle case. The case was about
the color of the basket, and, of course, a
spectacle case is not large.</p>

<p>“But here they are, safe, and how glad
Mrs. Martin will be,” said Mrs. Bobbsey.
“I’ll mail them right back to her.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</span></p>

<p>This was done, and a grateful letter of
thanks came in reply a few days later.</p>

<p>“Baby Jenny misses the children,” Mrs.
Watson had added in a postscript to her
cousin’s missive.</p>

<p>“And we miss her,” said Nan. “But I’ve
got something more to put in my composition—I’m
going to write about the lost glasses
and how they were found in the peaches.”</p>

<p>School opened about a week later, and
after the first few sessions Miss Skell brought
up the subject of the vacation compositions.
She gave the children three days in which to
write and hand in their essays, and Nan
worked hard. Bert also wrote one, but he
spent so little time over it that his mother
said he would not stand much chance of
winning the prize.</p>

<p>At last the day came when the decision was
to be made. There were some anxious hearts
among the boys and girls in Miss Skell’s
class as the teacher faced them ready to tell
who had won the prize.</p>

<p>“Most of you did very well,” said their
instructor. “Much better than I expected.
There were some excellent compositions
handed in—and some very poor and short<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</span>
ones.” As she said this she seemed to look
at Bert Bobbsey. “But the best of all was
Nan Bobbsey’s,” went on Miss Skell. “So
I award her the prize and I am going to ask
her to come up here and read her composition
to you. I think you will all enjoy it. The
name of it is ‘A Vacation in the Country.’
Come, Nan.”</p>

<p>Nan blushed, but, proud and happy, she
read her story and the boys and girls all said
it was most interesting. Nan told in an
entertaining way about many of the incidents
that had taken place at Cloverbank,
and on the way there and back, just as they
have been told to you here.</p>

<p>“Now what books do you want for a prize?”
asked Miss Skell, when Nan had finished.</p>

<p>“A set of nice story books for girls, if you
please,” was the answer.</p>

<p>And that is what Nan received a little later.
She still has those books, and thinks them the
best in her little library.</p>

<p>“Well, we certainly had fun at Cloverbank,”
said Bert to his brother and sisters
that afternoon on their way home from
school, Nan hurrying to tell the good news
about winning the prize.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</span></p>

<p>“Lots of fun,” she agreed.</p>

<p>“Wasn’t it funny when Freddie and I
saw the bear that turned into a calf?”
laughed Flossie.</p>

<p>“And wasn’t it fun that day when we
played outdoors in the rain?” asked Freddie.
“I wonder if we’ll ever have fun like that
again?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I guess so,” said Bert.</p>

<p>Whether the Bobbsey twins did or not
remains to be seen.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
